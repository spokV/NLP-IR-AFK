I WOULD BE PLEASED TO RECEIVE ANY PAPERS DESCRIBING FREE TEXT
RETRIEVAL PACKAGES LIKE CAIRS, ASSASIN, STATUS, DECO OR STAIRS,
ESPECIALLY IF THE FEATURES OF DIFFERENT PACKAGES ARE COMPARED, OR IF
THE IMPLEMENTATION AND USE OF A SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED.  I AM ESPECIALLY
INTERESTED IN PACKAGES FOR MINIS AND MICROS AND IN ANY ASSOCIATION
BETWEEN FREE TEXT RETRIEVAL PACKAGES AND DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.
MINICOMPUTERS, MICROCOMPUTERS, DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, FREE TEXT
