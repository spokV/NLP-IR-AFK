I WOULD BE PLEASED TO RECEIVE ANY INFORMATION ON THE USE OF JOURNALS
IN LIBRARIES (ANY TYPES OF LIBRARY), BOTH CURRENT AND BACK ISSUES.
I AM ALSO INTERESTED IN INFORMATION ON THE WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIES
HAVE COPED WITH CUTS IN PERIODICALS BUDGETS.
PERIODICALS, JOURNALS, LIBRARIES, USER STUDIES, CUTS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES,
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES, POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES,
HIGHER EDUCATION LIBRARIES.
