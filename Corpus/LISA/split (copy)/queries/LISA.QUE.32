MY DISSERTATION IS ON THE PROVISION OF AUDIO-VISUAL RESOURCES IN
POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES. I INTEND TO SEND A QUESTIONNAIRE TO ALL 30
POLYTECHNICS AND TO VISIT SIX AND BASE MY STUDY ON THESE SIX.
I WOULD ALSO BE INTERESTED TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ON AUDIO-VISUAL
RESOURCES IN ANY TYPE OF ACADEMIC LIBRARY, NOT JUST POLYTECHNICS.
POLYTECHNIC, POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES, ACADEMIC LIBRARIES,
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES, HIGHER EDUCATION LIBRARIES, AUDIO-VISUAL, RESOURCE
CENTRES, RESOURCE COLLECTIONS, NON-BOOK MEDIA.
