I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ON NON-USERS OF LIBRARIES,
INCLUDING ANY STUDIES OF WHO ARE NON-USERS AND WHY THEY ARE NON-USERS.
I WOULD BE ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL FOR PAPERS GIVING THE METHODOLOGICAL
APPROACHES USED IN THESE STUDIES AND THE RESULTS OBTAINED.
NON-USE, LIBRARY USE, USER STUDIES.
