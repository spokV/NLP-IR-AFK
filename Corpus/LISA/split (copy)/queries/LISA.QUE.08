I AM INTERESTED IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH LIBRARIES ARE CHARGING FOR
SERVICES.  THIS REFERS TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN PARTICULAR THOUGH I WOULD
BE INTERESTED IN OTHER LIBRARIES ALSO.  I WOULD BE PLEASED TO RECEIVE
PAPERS ON CHARGING FOR ANY SERVICE THE LIBRARY OFFERS, ESPECIALLY ONLINE
SEARCHING.  I AM INTERESTED IN MANAGEMENT OF CHARGING AND THE PHILOSOPHY
BEHIND IT, I.E. WHETHER ALL THE SERVICES SHOULD BE FREE. CHARGING
POLICIES, FEES FOR SERVICES.
