THE IMPACT OF PRESTEL ON PUBLIC LIBRARY REFERENCE ACTIVITIES.

DESCRIBES A PROJECT AIMED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF PRESTEL ON PUBLIC LIBRARY
REFERENCE SERVICES FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF USERS AND LIBRARY STAFF, AS WELL AS
CONSIDERING THE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS SUCH AS STOCK ACQUISITION, BUDGET AND
SPACE USE. PRESTEL AND TELETEXT RECEIVERS WERE INSTALLED FOR 12 MONTHS IN
REFERENCE LIBRARIES IN THE LONDON BOROUGHS OF BEXLEY, HOUNSLOW, SUTTON AND
WALTHAM FOREST AND IN BIRMINGHAM AND NORWICH CENTRAL REFERENCE LIBRARIES.
PRESTEL WAS FOUND TO BE A USEFUL SUPPLEMENT TO EXISTING RESOURCES FOR
STATISTICAL, BUSINESS, NEWS AND LEISURE INFORMATION BUT THE STUDY INDICATED
FACTORS INHIBITING USE WHICH PRECLUDED MORE EXPERIMENTAL USE AND A MORE
THOROUGH TESTING OF THEIR APPLICATION IN REFERENCE LIBRARIES.
