AUTHORITY CONTROL' UNNECESSARY DETAIL OF NEEDED SUPPORT?.
     
AUTHORITY CONTROL IS THE SET OF PROCEDURES WHICH DETERMINES THE USE OF
CONSISTENT NAMES AND TERMINOLOGY, CHANGING RELATIONSHIPS AMONG SCHOLARLY
DISCIPLINES, CORPORATE BODIES, AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. GIVES EXAMPLES OF
AUTHORITY WORK FOR PERSONAL NAMES, CORPORATE NAMES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,
SERIES TITLES AND SUBJECT HEADINGS. SUGGESTS THAT AUTHORITY CONTROL IS
ESSENTIAL BECAUSE' CATALOGUES ARE GROWING AND BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT TO USE
SO THE USER MAY EASILY GET LOST WITHOUT AN AUTHORITY STRUCTURE TO PROVIDE
GUIDANCE; AND IF LIBRARIES FOLLOW GENERALLY THE SAME STANDARDS IN ESTABLISHING
BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS, THE TASK OF MATCHING RECORDS AMONG LIBRARIES WILL BE
MADE CONSIDERABLY EASIER.
