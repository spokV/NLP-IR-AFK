PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 33RD ANNUAL MEETING, ASSOCIATION FOR ASIAN STUDIES,
INC., TORONTO, CANADA, 13-15 MAR 81. DISCUSSES THE MEANING OF COLLECTION
DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1980S AND THE FISCAL ADVERSITIES FACING EAST ASIAN
COLLECTIONS IN THE USA (INFLATION, BUDGET CUTS, DRAMATIC INCREASES IN COSTS OF
EAST ASIAN BOOKS AND POSTAGE RATES, ND INCREASED DANGER OF CUTS IN
UNDER-UTILISED COLLECTIONS SUCH AS THOSE SPECIALISING IN EAST ASIA). SUGGESTS
STRATEGIES (SPECIALISATION, COOPERATION, SHARING CHECKLISTS OF UNIQUE
HOLDINGS, REDUCTION OF DUPLICATION, AND OPTIMAL USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY) AND
DESCRIBES THE PREPARATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT MADE BY THE EAST ASIAN
COLLECTION OF THE HOOVER INSTITUTION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY, CALIFORNIA.
