PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB TECHNICAL TRANSLATION GROUP CONFERENCE, LONDON,
20 NOV 80. WITH CLOSER ECONOMIC COOPERATION WORLDWIDE AND INCREASING NUMBERS
OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND MEETINGS THE COST OF TRANSLATION AND
INTERPRETING SERVICES MAY BECOME TOO HEAVY A BURDEN UNLESS SOLUTIONS FOR
REDUCING COSTS CAN BE FOUND. THERE IS A DANGER OF INTRODUCING NEW BARRIERS
INTO INTERLINGUAL COMMUNICATION RESULTING FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW
TECHNOLOGY ITSELF SUCH AS DOCUMENTATION AND COMMAND LANGUAGES. DESCRIBES THE
EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME THESE BARRIERS. STANDARDISATION
AGREEMENTS ARE URGENTLY REQUIRED AMONG MANUFACTURERS OF HARDWARE, DESIGNERS OF
SOFTWARE, HOSTS OF DATA BASES AND PRODUCERS OF TRANSLATIONS AND TERMINOLOGY.
BRIEFLY OUTLINES NEW FORMS OF TRANSLATION THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE.
