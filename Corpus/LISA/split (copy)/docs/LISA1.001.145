THE ART OF US SYSTEMS AND NETWORKING, PARTICULARLY RELATED TO EVALUATION AND
ADMINISTRATION OF NETWORKS. THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE FOR ALL LIBRARIES IS THAT
DEPENDENCY OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES ON EACH OTHER'S RESOURCES HAS BECOME A
CRITICAL DEPENDENCY. COSTS OF SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS ARE BECOMING MORE
SIGNIFICANT, AS IS THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IN SYSTEM OPERATION. THE RIGHT AND
RESPONSIBILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES AS SYSTEM MEMBERS MUST BE SEEN FROM A
FRESH PERSPECTIVE.
