FINANCIAL IMPACTS OF NETWORKING AND RESOURCE SHARING.
     
LIBRARY COOPERATIVES WILL EVOLVE MORE INTO AUTOMATED LIBRARY NETWORKS WHICH
ARE GENERALLY MORE COST-EFFECTIVE, LESS LABOUR-INTENSIVE, AND PROVIDE MORE AND
BETTER SERVICE. THE MORE SUCCESSFUL US NETWORKS ARE THOSE WHERE THE MEMBER
LIBRARIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT WITH FUNDS FROM THEIR LOCAL LIBRARIES'
OPERATING BUDGETS AND WHICH VIEW THE SERVICES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THEIR
ESSENTIAL OPERATIONS. COST-EFFECTIVE NETWORKS ARE CHARACTERISED BY GREATER
COMPETITION, LESS STATE AND FEDERAL CONTROL, AND MORE RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT. THE NETWORK'S ECONOMIC REVOLUTION FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS
BEGINNING TO OCCUR WHERE AUTOMATED NETWORKS HAVE EXTENDED SERVICES DIRECTLY TO
THE USERS IN THEIR HOMES.
