NOT ALL IN THE MIND: THE VIRILE PROFESSION.

DISCUSSES THE FACTORS LEADING TO THE ORIGIN OF THE STEREOTYPE LIBRARIAN (A
'FUSSY OLD WOMAN OF EITHER SEX, MYOPIC AND REPRESSED, BRANDISHING OR PERHAPS
COWERING BEHIND A DATE-STAMP AND SURROUNDED BY AN ARRAY OF NOTICES WHICH
FORBID VIRTUALLY EVERY HUMAN ACTIVITY'); ITS PERPETUATION IN THE MEDIA TODAY;
ATTEMPTS BY LIBRARIANS TO REDEEM THEIR IMAGE (MOST ATTEMPTS BACKFIRE,
ENHANCING THE IMAGE EVEN MORE); THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF WOMEN IN AND LOW STATUS
OF THE LIBRARY PROFESSION, WHICH ARE BOUND UP WITH ITS IMAGE IN A WEB OF CAUSE
AND EFFECT; AND THE CONTRADICTION-LIBRARIANSHIP, THE BASTION OF THE MIDDLE
CLASSES, HAS WORKING CLASS ORIGINS.
