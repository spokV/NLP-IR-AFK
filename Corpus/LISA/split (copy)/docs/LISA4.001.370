ONLINE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS DATA BASE SEARCHING AND THE USE OF MICROFICHE
DOCUMENTS ONLINE BY ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC DEPOSITORY LIBRARIANS.
     
REPORTS FINDINGS RELATED TO ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC DEPOSITORY LIBRARIANS' USE OF
ON-LINE DATA BASE SEARCHING AND MICROFICHE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS ON-LINE.
OVERALL, THE DATA SUGGEST THAT DEPOSITORY LIBRARIANS ARE INVOLVED IN LITTLE
ON-LINE DATA BASE SEARCHING OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT DATA BASES, HAVE LIMITED
ACCESS TO ON-LINE TERMINALS, HAVE RECEIVED LITTLE TRAINING IN THE USE OF DATA
BASES, AND ACQUIRE VIRTUALLY NO MICROFORMATTED GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS
ON-LINE. THESE AND OTHER FINDINGS ARE DISCUSSED, FACTORS THAT ENCOURAGE AND
LIMIT THE USE OF ON-LINE SERVICES IN A DEPOSITORY LIBRARY ARE PRESENTED, AND
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE TO INCREASE DEPOSITORY LIBRARIANS' USE OF GOVERNMENT
DOCUMENT DATA BASES AND ACCESS TO MICROFICHE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS ON-LINE.
