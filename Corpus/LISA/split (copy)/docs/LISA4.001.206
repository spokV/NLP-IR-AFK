IT IS USELESS TO ECONOMISE WHEN MONEY IS IN SHORT SUPPLY.
     
THE GERMAN ECONOMY IS ADAPTING WITH DIFFICULTY TO THE RECESSION, TO THE
DETRIMENT OF PUBLIC BUDGETS. CULTURE IS IMPORTANT DURING ECONOMIC CRISES,
THEREFORE CULTURAL BODIES CANNOT RENEGE ON THEIR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES.
THRIFT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE MOST ECONOMIC PROCEDURE. AN ANALYSIS IS MADE OF
STATISTICS ON LIBRARY EXPENDITURE BY LARGE AND SMALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN WEST
GERMANY IN 1975-79 TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
STAFFING COSTS AND THE TOTAL BUDGET. A CAREFUL LIBRARY POLICY MUST RECOGNISE
THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF ADAPTING TO THE FINANCIAL SITUATION IN
THE LIGHT OF ITS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IF RATIONALISATION METHODS ARE
CARRIED OUT EFFICIENTLY, THE LIBRARY SERVICE CAN ADAPT IN THE RIGHT WAY.
