IN THE LAST DECADE A NEW INDUSTRY HAS EMERGED FROM THE CONJUNCTION OF DATA
BASES, COMPUTERS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. THE
GROWTH OF THIS INDUSTRY IS REVIEWED SHOWING HOW THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF
COMPUTERS FOR PRODUCTION PURPOSES PRODUCED NEW FORMS OF INFORMATION WHICH
ALLOWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTERISED RETRIEVAL. THE VARIOUS TRENDS IN THE
DATA BASE FIELD ARE IDENTIFIED AND THE RESULTS OF AN ECONOMIC MODELLING STUDY
ARE USED TO PROJECT FUTURE COST LEVELS FOR SEARCHING DATA BASES ON-LINE. THIS
GENERATES THE NEED FOR INCREASED TRAINING WITH DATA BASES IF INDUSTRY IS TO
GET MAXIMUM RETURN FROM THEIR USE.
