RESPONSIBILITY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY.
     
A TALK GIVEN AT A COURSE ON LEADERSHIP-PUBLIC LIBRARIES AT THE LOCAL
AUTHORITIES' HIGH SCHOOL, NOV 81. DISCUSSES POLITICIANS' EXPECTATIONS OF THE
LIBRARY AND ITS STAFF. COOPERATION BETWEEN LOCAL POLITICIANS AND LIBRARIANS IS
OFTEN HAMPERED BY THE LIBRARIANS' PREFERENCE FOR CENTRALLY IMPOSED NORMS
INSTEAD OF ADAPTATION TO LOCAL NEEDS. BUT IMPOSITION OF OBLIGATIONS TAKES AWAY
SPONTANEITY. OBJECTS TO SELF-APPOINTED MORALISTS GUIDING THE PEOPLE'S CULTURAL
NEEDS IN A CERTAIN IDEOLOGICAL DIRECTION. COMPREHENSIVENESS, ONE OF THE
LIBRARY OBJECTIVES, CANNOT BE ON THE BASIS OF A PARTICULAR BOOK, WHICH MUST
NECESSARILY PRESENT A PARTICULAR VIEWPOINT, BUT MUST BE AN OVERALL GUIDELINE.
THE LIBRARY LAW, LIKE MODERN EDUCATION AND SOCIAL LAWS, SHOULD SPECIFY AN
OBLIGATION TO DEVELOPMENT PLANNING IN THE INDIVIDUAL AUTHORITY, NOT LAY DOWN
EXTERNAL STRUCTURAL NORMS WITHOUT REGARD TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. THE LEADING
LIBRARIAN AND THE LEADING HEAD TEACHER MUST HAVE EQUAL  SAY ON THE CULTURAL
COMMITTEE TO SECURE LIBRARIES' INDEPENDENCE FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE LEADER FROM
THE EDUCATION SERVICE. LIBRARIES MUST NOURISH THE QUALIFIED DOUBT AND SUPPLY
THE MEANS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OF EXPERT KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY IN THE
DEMOCRATIC DECISION MAKING PROCESS. LIBRARIES AND LOCAL POLITICIANS MUST
COOPERATE IN KEEPING ART AND CULTURE INDEPENDENT OF POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL
INFLUENCE.
