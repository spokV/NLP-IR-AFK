STARTING LIBRARY RESEARCH!.
     
INTERVIEWS JOHN P. WILKINSON, LEADER OF THE CENTRE FOR RESEARCH IN
LIBRARIANSHIP, TORONTO, WHO DESCRIBES HIS CAREER IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CENTRE IN 1975. THE CENTRE IS SUPPORTED FINANCIALLY BY
FUNDED RESEARCH ONLY, BUT IS HELPED ALSO BY ITS PROXIMITY TO CANADA'S LARGEST
RESEARCH LIBRARY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO. FOR A RESEARCH PROJECT IN
LIBRARIANSHIP TO BE SUCCESSFUL, THE PROBLEM MUST BE OF CURRENT INTEREST SO
THAT IT CAN ATTRACT FUNDS, IT MUST BE AN AREA IN WHICH ONE SPECIALISES, AND
HELP MUST BE SOUGHT FROM OTHER EXPERTS. EXPLAINS WHAT A RESEARCH PROBLEM IS
AND HOW IT IS FORMULATED IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE RESEARCH PROCESS. DISCUSSES THE
RESEARCH INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERSONALITY TRAITS AND EFFECTIVE
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT, AND ARGUES THAT RESEARCHERS SHOULD RESOLVE PROBLEMS WHICH
HINDER DECISION-MAKING, BUT THEY SHOULD NOT MAKE THE DECISIONS THEMSELVES.
RESEARCH METHODS IS A COMPULSORY SUBJECT IN THE UNIVERSITY'S MLS PROGRAMME,
STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH IF LIBRARIANSHIP IS TO BECOME A
PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE DISCIPLINE.
