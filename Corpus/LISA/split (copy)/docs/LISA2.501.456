THE USE OF TRIGRAM ANALYSIS FOR SPELLING ERROR DETECTION.
     
WORK PERFORMED UNDER THE SPELLING ERROR DETECTION CORRECTION PROJECT
(SPEEDCOP) SUPPORTED BY NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) AT CHEMICAL
ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) TO DEVISE EFFECTIVE AUTOMATIC METHODS OF DETECTING AND
CORRECTING MISSPELLINGS IN SCHOLARLY AND SCIENTIFIC TEXT IS DESCRIBED. THE
INVESTIGATION WAS APPLIED TO 50,000 WORD/MISSPELLING PAIRS COLLECTED FROM 6
DATASETS (2CHEMICAL INDUSTRY NOTES, BIOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS, CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1,
AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY PRIMARY JOURNAL KEYBOARDING, 2INFORMATION SCIENCE
ABSTRACTS1, AND DISTRIBUTED ON-LINE EDITING (DOLE) (A CAS INTERNAL DATASET
ESPECIALLY SUITED TO SPELLING ERROR STUDIES). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO
DETERMINE THE UTILITY OF TRIGRAM ANALYSIS IN THE AUTOMATIC DETECTION AND/OR
CORRECTION OF MISSPELLINGS.
