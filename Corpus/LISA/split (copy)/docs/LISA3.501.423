ON THE INTEGRATION OF DATA-, TEXT- AND FACSIMILE COMMUNICATION IN LIBRARIES.
     
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNIQUES IN THE FIELD OF COMMUNICATION AND STORAGE IS
A CHALLENGE FOR LIBRARIES. IN SOME FIELDS THESE TECHNIQUES ARE ALREADY IN USE;
JOINT CATALOGUING WITH ON-LINE CONNECTION TO A DATA BANK, INFORMATION TRANSFER
BY ACCESS TO DATA BASES, USE OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA FOR ORIENTATION AND USER
TRAINING. OTHER USES INCLUDE VIEWDATA, TELECOPIER, TEXT PROCESSING MACHINES
AND THE STORAGE OF MASS PICTURES AND TEXTS ON VIDEO DISCS INSTEAD OF
MICROFILM.
