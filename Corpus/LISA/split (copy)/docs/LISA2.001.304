COMPETENCY-BASED EDUCATION AND LIBRARY INSTRUCTION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. EXPLAINS BRIEFLY
THE MEANING OF COMPETENCY-BASED EDUCATION-AN EDUCATIONAL APPROACH WHICH
STRUCTURES LEARNING AROUND COMPETENCIES DEFINED AS FUNDAMENTAL FOR SUCCESSFUL
PERFORMANCE, AND APPLIES THE CONCEPT TO LIBRARY USER EDUCATION. DISCUSSES THE
EXPERIENCES OF THE FOLLOWING US EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN
COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAMMES' ALVERNO COLLEGE; DOANE COLLEGE; SANGAMON STATE
UNIVERSITY; THE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE; FINDLAY COLLEGE; AND THE UNIVERSITY
OF WISCONSIN-PARKSIDE. IDENTIFIES SOME OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT CAN BE
DERIVED FROM ADOPTING THE COMPETENCY BASED APPROACH TO LIBRARY INSTRUCTION,
BUT RECOGNISES ITS LIMITATIONS, AND POINTS OUT THAT IT MAY BE UNSUITABLE FOR
SOME INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE IT IS TOO TIME CONSUMING AND DEMANDING.
