LABORING IN THE VINEYARDS WILL NOT SUFFICE TO SAVE THE SCHOOL LIBRARY VINTAGE.

AUSTRALIAN SCHOOL LIBRARIANSHIP HAVING MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN THE
1970S APPEARS TO BE IN NEED OF AN INFLUX OF VITALITY IN THE 1980S. OLD AND NEW
PROBLEMS ARE INVESTIGATED, THE NEED FOR SOUND PLANNING IS ASSERTED, THE
QUESTIONS OF ROLE AND PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY ARE ADDRESSED AND A PLACE FOR
SCHOOL LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE LARGER INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT IS ADVOCATED. THE
PROBLEMS OF EDUCATING SCHOOL LIBRARIANS ARE HIGHLIGHTED WITH SUPPORTING
EVIDENCE FROM A RECENT STUDY. CONCLUDING STATEMENTS CALL FOR A CHANGE AND
DEVELOPMENT THROUGH IMPROVED STAFFING LEVELS OF QUALIFIED PRACTITIONERS,
COUPLED WITH SOUND MANAGERIAL PLANNING, MONITORING, EDUCATIONAL AND EVALUATIVE
PROCEDURES.
