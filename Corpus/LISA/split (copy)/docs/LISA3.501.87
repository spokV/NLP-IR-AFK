ONE WORD MORE ABOUT COSINESS..
     
DESCRIBES GENTOFTE MAIN PUBLIC LIBRARY AND INTERVIEWS LIBRARIANS, USERS AND
THE CULTURAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN. THE 1ST IMPRESSION OF COSINESS IS DISPELLED
ON CLOSER EXAMINATION, WHICH REVEALS GROSS OVERCROWDING IN STAFF WORKING
AREAS. THE PRESENT BUILDING WAS ERECTED IN 1928 AND ADDITIONS WERE SOON
NECESSARY. THE CHILDREN'S SECTION, THE CATALOGUE DEPARTMENT AND THE STACKS ARE
PLACED ELSEWHERE WITH ENSUING TRANSPORT PROBLEMS. SEVERAL PLANS FOR A NEW
LIBRARY HAVE BEEN STOPPED BY GOVERNMENT CUTS, DESPITE LOCAL POLITICAL
GOODWILL. HOWEVER, GENTOFTE LIBRARY SERVICE AS A WHOLE IS WELL PROVIDED, WITH
5 BRANCH LIBRARIES, ART LIBRARY, SPOKEN NEWSPAPER, DOMICILIARY LENDING
SERVICE, HOSPITAL SERVICE, CENTRAL GUEST WORKERS' COLLECTION, AND ARRANGEMENTS
FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN. THE CUTS HAVE COME AT A TIME OF INCREASING LOANS, BUT
STILL LEAVE THE LIBRARY ABOVE AVERAGE IN MATERIALS AND STAFF. DESCRIBES THE 2
YEAR EXPERIMENT WHICH BEGAN AT GENTOFTE ON 1 MAR 81 WITH ON-LINE SE ARCHING
USING THE DIALOG AND EURONET DATA BASES. THE LIBRARY RECEIVES ABOUT 2,000
SUBJECT ENQUIRIES FROM OTHER LIBRARIES IN THE COUNTY; ONLY THOSE WHICH ARE
DEEMED AT A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH LEVEL (15%) ARE DEALT WITH BY THE COMPUTER.
