LIBRARY WORK WITH HANDICAPPED CHILDREN IN A BRANCH LIBRARY.
     
THE LIBRARIAN AT A BRANCH LIBRARY IN POTSDAM WORKS CLOSELY WITH TEACHERS AT
THE SPECIAL SCHOOL NEARBY, DISCUSSING SUITABLE LIBRARY MATERIAL AND ARRANGING
SPECIAL EVENTS SUCH AS AUTHORS' VISITS. CHILDREN FROM THE LOWER FORMS ARE
BROUGHT INTO THE LIBRARY TO SAMPLE THE BOOKS AND LEARN ABOUT THE LIBRARY
SERVICE; THE CHILDREN ENJOY THEIR VISITS AND OFTEN RETURN AGAIN DURING LEISURE
HOURS. STOCKS MOST USEFUL TO THEM ARE LARGE PRINT BOOKS AND PICTORIAL
MATERIAL. THE LIBRARIAN HAS ACQUIRED A GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF INDIVIDUAL READERS
AND THEIR INTERESTS. THROUGH CLOSE COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES,
HANDICAPPED READERS FROM OTHER AREAS OFTEN COME TO USE THIS LIBRARY. GOOD
CONTACTS WITH PARENTS ARE ALSO VALUABLE; A MEETING IS PLANNED TO INTRODUCE
PARENTS TO LITERATURE ON DIFFERENT KINDS OF HANDICAP.
