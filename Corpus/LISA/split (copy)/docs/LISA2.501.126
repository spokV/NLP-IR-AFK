FEAR OF TALKING' WHICH STUDENTS IN THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY ASK LIBRARIANS FOR
HELP?.
     
FOR MANY LIBRARY USERS, THE LIBRARIAN IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF ANY SEARCH
STRATEGY. AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS
OF 1 COMMUNICATION VARIABLE, COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION (CA), THE FEAR OF
TALKING, ON THE USER'S DECISION TO SEARCH A LIBRARY INDEPENDENTLY OR WITH THE
LIBRARIAN'S ASSISTANCE. IT WAS FOUND THAT RESPONDENTS, REGARDLESS OF CA LEVEL,
BEHAVED SIMILARLY IN SEARCHING A LIBRARY WHEN MEASURED IN TERMS OF INITIAL
STEP, NUMBER OF STEPS, AND LENGTH OF SEARCH TIME. CA WAS ELIMINATED AS A
VARIABLE INFLUENCING THE INITIATION OF AN INTERACTION WITH A LIBRARIAN.
FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE ITS POSSIBLE EFFECTS ONCE THAT
INTERACTION HAS BEGUN.
