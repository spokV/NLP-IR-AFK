WE MUST PRESENT THE FULL BREADTH OF THE SWEDISH BOOK MARKET.
     
INTERVIEWS JAN GUMPERT, DIRECTOR OF THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SERVICE, WHO DISCUSSES
THE IMPACT OF CUTS ON THE LIBRARIES. LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE FINDING THEIR
CULTURAL BUDGETS, WITH LIBRARIES AS THE LARGEST ITEM, EASY TARGETS. ATTEMPTS
ARE MADE TO SAVE THE BOOK BUDGET AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND CUTS ARE MADE INSTEAD
IN OPENING HOURS AND ACTIVITIES. VACANCIES ARE LIKELY TO BE FROZEN. FOR THE
LIBRARY SERVICE THE CUTS MEAN THAT THE STOCK OF OLDER TITLES WILL HAVE TO BE
REDUCED, BUT THERE ARE NO PLANS TO CUT THE NUMBER OF TITLES OFFERED. EXPORT OF
LIBRARY FURNITURE TO THE ARAB WORLD ALLEVIATES SOMEWHAT THE LACK OF MARKETS IN
SWEDEN. THE SERVICE'S COMPUTER SYSTEM, BUMS, IS NOW INSTALLED IN 34 LOCAL
AUTHORITIES. THERE IS CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES'
AUTOMATION SYSTEM LIBRIS. DISCUSSES THE IMPACT OF THE LITERATURE COMMISSION
AND THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES COMMISSION.
