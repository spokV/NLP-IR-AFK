THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR
LIBRARIES.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BERLIN 1980. THE EUPHORIA FROM LIBRARY PLANNING IN THE 1970S
HAS NOW FADED, LEAVING BEHIND SCEPTICISM AS TO WHETHER THE PLANS CAN BE
CARRIED OUT. LIBRARY PLANNING WITHOUT A LEGAL BASIS IS NOT BINDING; THE LAW
SHOULD PROVIDE A LEGAL FRAMEWORK, LOCAL AUTHORITY PLANNING THE DETAILED
DESCRIPTION OF CONCRETE AIMS. PLANNING STAGES ARE DESCRIBED WITH REFERENCE TO
THE FRANKFURT-AM-MAIN LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN OF 1972. LIBRARY PLANNING IS
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN TIMES OF FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY; A LOCAL AUTHORITY'S
FINANCIAL CAPACITY MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ORDER TO AVOID COST INFLATION.
LIBRARY PLANS CAN BE REGARDED AS PACEMAKERS ON THE WAY TO A BETTER DEVELOPMENT
OF LIBRARY SERVICES.
