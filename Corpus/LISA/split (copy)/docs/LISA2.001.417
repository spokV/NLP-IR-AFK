DEVELOPMENTS IN OPTICAL DISC TECHNOLOGY AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR INFORMATION
STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL.
     
BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE AUTHOR'S 1-MONTH VISIT TO THE USA IN APR-MAY 80
AND A SUBSEQUENT BRIEF VISIT TO PHILIPS DATA SYSTEMS IN THE NETHERLANDS,
DURING WHICH HE DISCUSSED OPTICAL DISCS WITH MANUFACTURERS AND PROSPECTIVE
USERS. INDICATES THAT PROSPECTS FOR THE USE OF OPTICAL DISCS IN TEXTUAL AND
GRAPHICAL INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL ARE GOOD. THERE ARE APPLICATIONS
FOR REPLICATED VIDEO DISCS, ESPECIALLY IF THEY CAN BE MASTERED WITH DIGITALLY
CODED INFORMATION, BUT THE MAJOR IMPACT WILL COME WITH THE DIGITAL OPTICAL
RECORDING SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE 'READ AND WRITE' FACILITIES.
