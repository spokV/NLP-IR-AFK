COMPUTER SIMULATION OF PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ORGANIC MOLECULES. 1.
MOLECULAR SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION.

A COMPUTER PROGRAM WHICH GENERATES MOLECULAR GEOMETRIES AND PERFORMS MOLECULAR
CALCULATIONS FOR ORGANIC MOLECULES IS PRESENTED. A LINEAR CODING METHODOLOGY
USED FOR INPUTTING THE MOLECULES IS ALSO DESCRIBED. THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF
A PROGRAM AIMED AT THE SIMULATION OF THE PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF
ORGANIC MOLECULES.
