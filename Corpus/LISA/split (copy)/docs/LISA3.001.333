COST RECOVERY' THE CASE AGAINST.
     
ARGUES AGAINST THE CONCEPT OF COST RECOVERY FOR INTERLOANS ON THE GROUNDS THAT
THIS WOULD IMPEDE THE FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION IN THE COMMUNITY, AND THAT THE
DISABILITIES OF THE LARGE NET LENDING LIBRARIES SHOULD BE EASED IN OTHER WAYS
SUCH AS SPECIAL SUBSIDY, A WIDER SPREAD OF DEMAND OVER A GREATER NUMBER OF
LIBRARIES AS BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORKS DEVELOP, IMPROVED TRAINING OF INTERLOAN
OFFICERS AND POSSIBLY BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL LENDING
LIBRARY OF 1ST RESORT.
