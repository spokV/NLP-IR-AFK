THE IMPACT OF BASIC RESEARCH IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES: THE CASE OF EDUCATION.

RECENT EVALUATIONS OF THE CONDITION AND FUNDING OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH IN THE
USA ASSUMES THAT BASIC RESEARCH IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES IS A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN
INCREASING UNDERSTANDING OF AND ULTIMATELY IMPROVING THE PRACTICE OF
EDUCATION. PAST TESTS OF THIS ASSUMPTION, HOWEVER, HAVE GENERALLY RELIED UPON
ARGUMENT BY EXAMPLE OR ANECDOTE. IN THIS STUDY, CITATION PATTERNS IN EDUCATION
LITERATURE ARE ANALYSED TO TEST THE COROLLARY PROPOSITION THAT BASIC RESEARCH
IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES HAS HAD A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON EDUCATION LITERATURE.
EMPIRICAL DATA COLLECTED ON CITATION PATTERNS IN THE EDUCATION LITERATURE ARE
FOUND TO BE LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH THIS PROPOSITION.
