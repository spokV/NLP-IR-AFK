FINAL REPORT OF THE PRECIS/TRANSLINGUAL PROJECT.
     
THE FEASIBILITY OF PROVIDING PRECIS WITH EXTRA FACILITIES TO ENABLE IT TO
FUNCTION AS A SYSTEM FOR SWITCHING INDEXING DATA BETWEEN 2 OR MORE NATURAL
LANGUAGES WAS INVESTIGATED. LEXICONS WERE ESTABLISHED IN 3 LANGUAGES, AND A
'PIVOT FILE' CREATED TO LINK THEM. ROUTINES FOR SWITCHING INDEXING TERMS OUT
OF A GIVEN SOURCE LANGUAGE AND INTO A CHOSEN TARGET LANGUAGE WERE DEVISED AND
SET DOWN IN THE FORM OF FLOW-CHARTS OR ALGORITHMS. USING THESE ALGORITHMS,
PRECIS STRINGS WERE SWITCHED MAINLY BETWEEN ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND GERMAN.
PROBLEMS OF TRANSLATION WERE SOLVED BY THE USE OF 'LEXICAL BLOCKS' AND THE
ADOPTION OF A SYSTEM OF CATEGORIES. MECHANISMS FOR THE AUTOMATIC PROVISION OF
ARTICLES IN FRENCH AND GERMAN STRINGS WERE DESIGNED. 2 METHODS OF PROVIDING
INFLECTED FORMS OF NOUNS BY ALGORITHM WERE TESTED IN GERMAN AND POLISH. THE
USE OF 'SUBSTITUTE' PHRASES IN PRECIS WAS INVESTIGATED, AND PROCEDURES FOR THE
AUTOMATIC PROVISION AND CONSTRUCTION OF PHRASES IN A TARGET LANGUAGE WERE
DEVISED. ALGORITHMS DESIGNED TO BUILD PREPOSITIONAL OR ADJECTIVAL PHRASES WERE
TESTED ON ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND GERMAN PRECIS STRINGS.
