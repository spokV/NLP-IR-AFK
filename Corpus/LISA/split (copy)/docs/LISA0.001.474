INFORMATION ON PUBLIC DOCUMENTS.

THE ANNUAL BIBLIOGRAPHY OF NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS (25TH ISSUE 1980)
IS SURPRISINGLY LITTLE-KNOWN TO LIBRARIES AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, CONSIDERING
THE SHORTAGE OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AIDS TO PUBLIC DOCUMENTS. ITS SCOPE HAS VARIED
OVER THE YEARS; RECENTLY IT HAS COVERED INSTITUTIONS LISTED IN THE NORWEGIAN
GOVERNMENT YEARBOOK. IT COVERS CERTAIN PUBLICATIONS NOT IN THE NORWEGIAN
NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. ENTRIES ARE BY INSTITUTION, WITH DEWEY NUMBERS AND
SIMPLIFIED BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS. PART I (BOOKS, ARTICLES, ANNUAL REPORTS
AND BROCHURES; ABOUT 2300 ENTRIES ANNUALLY) HAS NAME AND CLASSIFIED INDEXES,
WHILE PART II (CIRCULARS; ABOUT 1500 ENTRIES) HAS APPEARED SEPARATELY SINCE
1975. 1200 COPIES ARE PRINTED, OF WHICH 600 GO TO SUBSCRIBERS AND SOME 75 TO
FOREIGN LIBRARIES. POSSIBLY ALL NORWEGIAN COUNTY AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD
RECEIVE FREE COPIES AS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THEIR INFORMATION SERVICE.
