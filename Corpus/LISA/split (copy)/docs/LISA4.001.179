PRESENTS THE MAIN POINTS COVERED BY PETER QUARRY IN A TALK AT A SCHOOL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION OF VICTORIA (AUSTRALIA) SOUTH-EASTERN BRANCH MEETING, MAR 81.
PRESENTS 3 BASIC STEPS FOR MORE EFFICIENT TIME MANAGEMENT IN LIBRARIES' (1)
AUDIT (A DIARY DETAILING HOW TIME IS SPENT FOR AT LEAST 2 DAYS AND PREFERABLY
FOR A WEEK); (2) ANALYSIS (AS SERIES OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING TIME SPENT ON
EACH TASK, WHETHER TASKS CAN BE DELEGATED, WHETHER TASKS ARE GIVEN TOO MUCH
TIME OR NEGLECTED COMPLETELY-THIS SHOULD EXPOSE THE ENEMY, TIME WASTERS); AND
(3) ACTION (THE AIM BEING TO ELIMINATE TIME WASTERS, ORGANISE THE AVAILABLE
TIME EFFICIENTLY, AND DELEGATE TASKS WHERE POSSIBLE).
