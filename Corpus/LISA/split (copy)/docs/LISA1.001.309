SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF SDI SYSTEMS (EXPERIENCE OF THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR INFORMATION AND ECONOMIC RESEARCH FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY).

DISCUSSES THE SDI SYSTEM DEVELOPED BY THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
INSTITUTE FOR INFORMATION AND ECONOMIC RESEARCH FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY. THE
SYSTEM IS USED TO PROVIDE SDI TO 2 MAIN GROUPS OF USERS' SCIENTISTS AND
MANAGEMENT OFFICERS. AS FAR AS THE 1ST USER GROUP IS CONCERNED THE OPERATION
OF THE SDI SERVICE IS SUCCESSFUL. IN 1978, OUT OF THE 150,000 SDI ITEMS SENT
OUT, ONLY 15% WERE RETURNED BY THE USERS AS IRRELEVANT. AS FAR AS THE LATTER
USER GROUP IS CONCERNED, THE CONTACT BETWEEN THE INFORMATION CENTRE AND THE
MEMBERS OF THE GROUP IS NOT SATISFACTORY. A SURVEY OF THE SDI REQUIREMENTS WAS
THEREFORE CARRIED OUT. RESULTS ARE PRESENTED.
