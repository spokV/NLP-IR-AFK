CITATION PATTERNS AND DOCUMENTATION FOR THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE' SOME
METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
     
RESEARCH EFFORTS FOR ARCHIVAL PRACTICE MUST AIM AT SHARPENING THE AWARENESS OF
THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS OF DOCUMENT PRODUCTION AND USE TO HELP ARCHIVISTS
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF DOCUMENTS IN THE HISTORICAL PROCESS. CITATION
STUDIES HAVE BEEN USED IN STUDYING PRACTICES AND PATTERNS IN CURRENT
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, BUT LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE REGARDING HISTORICAL
LITERATURE. DESCRIBES A PILOT STUDY IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE, BASED ON A
REFERENCE COUNT OF FOOTNOTES CITED IN 50 JOURNAL ARTICLES, PUBLISHED IN 1976
AND 77. ALTHOUGH RESULTS ARE PRELIMINARY ONLY, FIGURES HAVE SOME INTEREST IN
SUGGESTING GENERAL PATTERNS AND AS AN INDICATION OF WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE
WITH MORE SOPHISTICATED TECHNIQUES INVOLVING A LARGER SAMPLE AND IN-DEPTH
ANALYSIS.
