STUDY OF THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE TRANSLATION OF SUBJECT HEADINGS FROM
ENGLISH INTO KOREAN. 4 DIFFERENT SEMANTIC ENTITIES ARE INVOLVED-THE ENGLISH OF
THE ORIGINAL LIST, THE CLASSIFICATION NUMBERS, AND THE KOREAN TRANSLATION LIST
WHICH MUST USE BOTH CHINESE IDEOGRAMS AND THE KOREAN ALPHABET. ULTIMATELY THE
CLASSIFICATION NUMBER SERVES AS THE MOST ACCURATE GUIDE TO THE SEMANTIC
CONTENT OF THE ORIGINAL TERM, AS WELL AS A GUIDE TO THE MOST SUITABLE TERM TO
EXPRESS THIS IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ADAPTATION.
