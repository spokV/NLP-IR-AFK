READERS AND THEIR READING TRENDS IN THE BRITISH COUNCIL LIBRARY, DELHI.
     
TO FIND OUT THE READING TRENDS OF THE READERS OF THE BRITISH COUNCIL LIBRARY,
DELHI, A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED TAKING THE BOOKS BORROWED DURING 28 JAN-9 FEB 80
ON MONDAYS, WEDNESDAYS, FRIDAYS AND SATURDAYS AS A SAMPLE. RESULTS OF THE
SURVEY HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH TABLES AND CHARTS. THE SURVEY INDICATES THAT
THE LIBRARY IS FUNCTIONING EFFECTIVELY, AND THE STUDENTS ARE THE LARGEST
SINGLE GROUP OF USERS. HOWEVER, THERE IS STRONG DISCONTENT AMONG ALL
CATEGORIES OF BORROWERS ABOUT THE MODERN FICTION COLLECTION. IT HAS BEEN
CONCLUDED THAT THE SURVEY WILL BE MOST HELPFUL IN THE FUTURE BOOK SELECTION
POLICY OF THE LIBRARY.
