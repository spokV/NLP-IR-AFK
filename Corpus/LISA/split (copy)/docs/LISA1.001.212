LIBRARIES AS A LINK IN A NATIONAL INFORMATION POLICY.

AN INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON LIBRARIES AS PUBLIC INFORMATION CENTRES INDICATES
THAT NORWAY IS POSSIBLY THE MOST ADVANCED OF THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES (THE
SWEDISH REPORT IS NOT AVAILABLE). MOVES ARE AFOOT TO CONVINCE COMMITTEES THAT
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, UNTIL NOW OVERLOOKED, ARE ALREADY LARGELY EQUIPPED AS
INFORMATION CENTRES. IN DENMARK A LIBRARY COMMISSION WAS SET UP IN 1976 TO
CONSIDER ALTERATIONS IN THE DANISH LIBRARY SERVICE, INCLUDING THE FORMATION OF
A NATIONAL INFORMATION AND LIBRARY POLICY, AND LEGISLATION IS EXPECTED
FOLLOWING THEIR 1979 REPORT. IN ICELAND A COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1975 TO
PLAN FUTURE INFORMATION POLICY, AND AN INFORMATION SERVICE, PARTLY
TECHNICAL/SCIENTIFIC AND PARTLY A GENERAL NATIONAL INFORMATION BODY, BEGAN
OPERATION IN 1978-79. FINLAND HAS SO FAR HAD NO OFFICIAL INFORMATION POLICY,
BUT IN 1980 INVESTIGATIONS BEGAN INTO REASONS FOR SUCH A POLICY, DEVELOPMENT
PLANS, AND RESOURCES REQUIRED. THE FINNISH SP EAKER DEALT MAINLY WITH SPECIAL
LIBRARIES.
