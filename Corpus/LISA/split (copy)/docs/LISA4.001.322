GRANT FUNDS PROVIDE IMPETUS FOR COMPREHENSIVE CONSERVATION PROGRAM.
     
RESEARCH LIBRARIES EVERYWHERE FACE THE PROBLEM OF CONSERVATION OF LIBRARY
MATERIALS. FUNDING FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS, IN THE PAST FEW YEARS,
STIMULATED RESEARCH, SPECIAL PROJECTS, AND PROGRAMMES SUCH AS THE NATIONAL
CONSERVATION ADVISORY COUNCIL AND THE NATIONAL PRESERVATION PROGRAM IN THE
USA. MORRIS LIBRARY, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, HAS EMBARKED UPON A
COMPREHENSIVE CONSERVATION PROGRAMME FOR ITS COLLECTIONS WITH GRANT FUNDS FROM
SEVERAL FUNDING BODIES. ITS PROGRAMME IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL. COMMITTED TO
CONSERVATION ON A BROAD SCALE, THE UNIVERSITY AND MORRIS LIBRARY SUPPORT
EFFORTS AIMED AT PRESERVING AND MAINTAINING RESEARCH MATERIALS VITAL TO THE
UNIVERSITY'S EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH PROGRAMMES, AND THE SCHOLARLY COMMUNITY
AT LARGE.
