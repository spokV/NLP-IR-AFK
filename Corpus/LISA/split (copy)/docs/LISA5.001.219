OECD GUIDELINES ON PRIVACY PROTECTION AND TRANSBORDER FLOWS.

THE GUIDELINES APPLY TO BOTH AUTOMATED AND MANUALLY-STORED PERSONAL DATA, BOTH
IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS. OECD BELIEVES THERE IS A DANGER THAT LEGAL
DISPARITIES COULD HAMPER THE FREE FLOW OF PERSONAL DATA ACROSS FRONTIERS, AND
THAT RESTRICTIONS COULD CAUSE SERIOUS DISRUPTION IN SUCH AREAS AS BANKING,
INSURANCE, AIRCRAFT RESERVATIONS, AND THE DISPATCH OF CONFIDENTIAL DATA
BETWEEN PARENT COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY IN MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES. THE FULL
TEXT OF THE GUIDELINES IS REPRINTED.
