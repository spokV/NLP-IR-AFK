TO CHARGE OR NOT TO CHARGE-WHO PAYS FOR THE INFORMATION.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 54TH ASLIB ANNUAL CONFERENCE, INFORMATION '81'
FORECASTS AND REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UK, 22-25 SEPT 81. THE TRUE COST
OF OBTAINING AND PRODUCING INFORMATION IS FREQUENTLY HIDDEN OR DISTORTED
THROUGH THE EXISTENCE OF A SYSTEM IN WHICH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS DO NOT
ALWAYS COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER AND MAY EVEN BE IN OPEN COMPETITION. LOOKS AT THE
AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON INFORMATION AROUND THE WORLD AND DISCUSSES THE VALUE
OF INFORMATION. TO CHARGE FOR INFORMATION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IS UNAVOIDABLE.
URGES A REDUCED INVOLVEMENT OF THE UK GOVERNMENT IN INFORMATION ACTIVITIES
PERIPHERAL TO SUPPORTING THE MAIN FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT AND ARGUES THAT WITH
THE STIMULATION OF INNOVATION THROUGH COMPETITIVE MARKET FORCES, THE QUALITY
AND RELEVANCE OF INFORMATION PRODUCTS WOULD GREATLY INCREASE.
