ARE SUBJECT INFORMATION CENTRES THE MODERN INFORMATION SOURCE FOR EVERYONE?.
     
LECTURE GIVEN IN BONN TO A STUDY GROUP FOR ARCHIVES, LIBRARIES AND
DOCUMENTATION CENTRES (N.D.)THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION PROGRAMME HAS AS ITS FOCAL POINT THE FOUNDATION OF 16
CENTRALISED SUBJECT INFORMATION CENTRES BETWEEN 1974 AND 1977. THIS INITIAL
STAGE IS NOT YET COMPLETED OWING TO LACK OF FUNDS; ONLY 3 CENTRES ARE FULLY
OPERATIONAL. THE ADEQUACY OF THESE CENTRES HAS BEEN QUESTIONED, ESPECIALLY
BECAUSE OF THE EMPHASIS ON CENTRALISATION AND THE INTRODUCTION OF MARKET
ECONOMY PRINCIPLES; INFORMATION STORED MIGHT BE SELECTED MAINLY TO SUIT
INDUSTRY. IT IS NOT YET KNOWN WHETHER LIBRARIES MUST CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS COSTS,
WHICH WILL BE EXPENSIVE. TRADE UNIONISTS FEAR THAT THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IN
THE CENTRES WILL RESULT IN STAFF STRESS AND THAT CENTRALISATION WILL REDUCE
EMPLOYMENT.
