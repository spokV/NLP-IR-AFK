BOOK THEFTS FROM UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AS A LEGAL PROBLEM.

THE THEFT OF BOOKS FROM LARGE, OPEN-PLAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IS A MANY-SIDED
PROBLEM. IT HAS REACHED SUCH PROPORTIONS THAT IT IS COSTING UNIVERSITIES IN
WEST GERMANY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DM EVERY YEAR AND SPECIAL DETECTOR SYSTEMS
HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN SOME LIBRARIES. THESE HAVE LED TO MANY WOULD-BE THEFTS
BEING PREVENTED AND CHARGES BEING BROUGHT FOR THEFT. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF
THESE CHARGES HAVE HAD TO BE DROPPED OWING TO LOOPHOLES IN LAWS APPLICABLE TO
BOOK THEFTS. GERMAN CRIMINAL LAW STIPULATES THAT THE INTENTION OF KEEPING AN
OBJECT MUST BE PRESENT TO CONSTITUTE A THEFT; THIS IS USUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO
PROVE IN THE CASE OF BOOK THEFTS. UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ALSO FAILS TO
PROVIDE ADEQUATE PENALTIES AND VARIES FROM ONE STATE TO THE NEXT. IT IS
NECESSARY TO DEFINE THE THEFT OF BOOKS AS AN OFFENCE IN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW,
PUNISHABLE BY A FINE THROUGHOUT WEST GERMANY.
