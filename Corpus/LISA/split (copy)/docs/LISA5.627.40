THE VIDEOGRAM REPORT-PUBLISHED TOO LATE?.

THE VIDEOGRAM COMMISSION'S REPORT SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIES SHOULD BE
DISTRIBUTION CENTRES FOR A BROAD SUPPLY OF GOOD QUALITY VIDEO RECORDINGS, BUT
VIDEO HAS ALREADY BECOME A MASS MARKET ARTICLE SUPPLIED THROUGH INTERNATIONAL
DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND LIBRARIES HAVE LITTLE CHANCE OF MAKING AN IMPACT. A
WORKING GROUP OF REPRESENTATIVES OF CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS, THE VIDMO-GROUP,
WAS FORMED ALREADY IN 1973; IT HOPED TO START EXPERIMENTS IN LIBRARIES WITH
PRODUCTION AND SHOWING OF VIDEOGRAMS, BUT TRADE UNION OPPOSITION MEANT THAT
THE SWEDISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION'S PROGRAMMES COULD NOT BE USED. OTHER
REPORTS HAVE APPEARED POINTING TO THE ADVANTAGES OF LIBRARIES AS DISTRIBUTORS
OF VIDEO, BUT WITHOUT STATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT PUBLIC LIBRARIES WILL NEVER BE
ABLE TO FULFIL THIS ROLE. SOME AREAS ARE, HOWEVER, OPEN TO LIBRARIES, PROVIDED
THEY COOPERATE WITH EACH OTHER AND OTHER ORGANISATIONS' VIDEOGRAMS FOR THE
DEAF AND OTHER HANDICAPPED; VIDEOGRAMS PRODUCED  DIRECTLY FOR THE MEDIUM BY
ARTISTS AND MEDIA WORKSHOPS; VIDEOGRAMS FOR CHILDREN; FOR EDUCATION IN
COOPERATION WITH THE EDUCATIONAL RADIO AND THE AV CENTRE; AND LOCALLY PRODUCED
MATERIAL FOR VIDEO.
