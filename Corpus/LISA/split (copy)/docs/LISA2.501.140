EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE USE OF TECHNICAL DICTIONARIES AND ENCYCLOPAEDIAS.
     
INCREASING INVOLVEMENT OF BULGARIA'S INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL SCIENTISTS
AND EXPERTS IN VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS, HAS LED TO MUCH HIGHER DEMAND
FOR DICTIONARIES, ENCYCLOPAEDIAS AND FOREIGN REFERENCE PUBLICATIONS. THE
AUTHOR'S POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH IN MAJOR SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND OTHER
SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN SOFIA HAS SHOWN GREAT CARE HAS BEEN TAKEN IN THE
CONTINUOUS UPDATING OF THE RELEVANT COLLECTIONS. THE PUBLICATIONS ARE, AT
LEAST PARTLY, AVAILABLE TO THE USERS IN OPEN ACCESS DEPARTMENTS AND/OR IN
SPECIALISED READING ROOMS, AS IN THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY.
NEVERTHELESS, IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE ACQUISITION DEPARTMENTS PAY EVEN CLOSER
ATTENTION TO REFERENCE PUBLICATIONS. COMPILATION OF A GENERAL CATALOGUE OF ALL
REFERENCE PUBLICATIONS IN THE CAPITAL'S LIBRARIES WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL.
REEDITED EVERY FEW YEARS, OR SUPPLEMENTED WITH AMENDMENTS AND APPENDICES, SUCH
A CATALOGUE WOULD BE AN INVALUABLE ASSET FOR THE PROSPECTIVE COMPUTERISED DATA
BANK OF SCIENTIFIC TERMINOLOGY.
