THE USE OF SECONDARY INFORMATION SOURCES FOR PATENT INFORMATION.

THE EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIALLY ORIENTED PATENT INFORMATION SERVICES MEANS THAT
INFORMATION ON PATENTS MUST BE QUALITATIVELY AND QUANTITATIVELY IMPROVED,
WHICH PRESUPPOSES THE USE OF RATIONAL PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING PATENT
DESCRIPTIONS. WITH EXAMPLES TAKEN FROM PATENT DESCRIPTIONS FROM EAST AND WEST
GERMANY, THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF SUBJECT DOCUMENTATION THROUGH THE
USE OF PRIMARY SOURCES OR ABSTRACTS ARE PRESENTED. GENERALLY THE BEST RESULTS
ARE ACHIEVED WHEN CONTENT ANALYSIS IS BASED ON AN ABSTRACT OR SUMMARY; PRIMARY
SOURCES ARE OFTEN OF EXCELLENT QUALITY, ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM EAST GERMANY,
BUT THEIR USE CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING.
