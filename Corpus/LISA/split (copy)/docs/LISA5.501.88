PROBLEMS AND TASKS OF LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION.

LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION MUST MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR EXISTING PREMISES AS
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS HAS BEEN SEVERELY RESTRICTED, AT LEAST
FOR THE TIME BEING. HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE CONDITIONS, LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES MUST BE UNDER CONSTANT REVIEW WITH THEIR IMPROVEMENT IN
MIND. BRANCHES ESTABLISHED IN THE STUDENTS' HALLS OF RESIDENCE HAVE TO PROVIDE
ALL STUDENTS WITH BASIC STUDY LITERATURE. THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF ANY
PARTICULAR ESTABLISHMENT HAS TO CATER FOR CENTRALISED AND COORDINATED
ACQUISITIONS AND PROCESSING. USE OF LITERATURE BY STUDENTS AND TEACHING STAFF
MUST ALSO BE FOLLOWED UP AND OBSOLETE ITEMS DISCARDED. GREATER ATTENTION MUST
BE PAID TO POLITICAL AND OTHER LITERATURE DEALING WITH SOCIAL SCIENCES,
ESPECIALLY IN FACULTIES OF APPLIED SCIENCE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT
AESTHETIC EDUCATION BY AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS. THE ROLE OF COMPUTERISED
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, NOW ON A TRIAL BASIS IN SCHOOLS OF ECON OMICS, WILL GROW
IN FUTURE. FOR EXPERT ADVICE LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION HAVE TO LOOK ABOVE
ALL TO THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN SOFIA WITH ITS METHODOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT AND
SPECIAL COUNCILS IN MANY SPHERES OF KNOWLEDGE.
