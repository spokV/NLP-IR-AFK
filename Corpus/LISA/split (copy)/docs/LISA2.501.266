SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION STRATEGY OF CHINOIN.
     
IN HUNGARY, PHARMACEUTICAL WORKS DEVOTE MUCH OF THEIR INCOME TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW COMPOUNDS. PATENTS MAY ONLY BE ISSUED FOR NEW MATERIALS AND
METHODS, SO INFORMATION ON PATENTS AND SPECIAL LITERATURE MUST BE UP TO DATE.
FOR THIS THE CHINOIN TECHNICAL LIBRARY USES CLASSIC AND MODERN COMPUTERISED
SERVICES. THE LIBRARY SUBSCRIBES TO ONLY 212 JOURNALS, BUT USES DERWENT MANUAL
CARD AND ABSTRACTING SERVICES, AND THE 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1 SEARCH SYSTEM.
RETROSPECTIVE SEARCHING IS CARRIED OUT MANUALLY THROUGH, FOR EXAMPLE,
2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1. IT IS PROPOSED TO COOPERATE DIRECTLY WITH THE COMPUTER
STATION AT THE OFFICE FOR SYSTEM ANALYSIS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR
TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DATA BANK, INCLUDING NEW
COMPOUNDS OF CHINOIN REPRESENTS A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION WITHIN
THE SYSTEM.
