THE ROLE OF LIBRARY COOPERATIVES IN AN AUSTRALIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORK.
     
REVIEWS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORK (ABN) FOR
EXISTING COOPERATIVES SUCH AS CLANN AND CAVAL. THE PERSONAL VIEW OF THE AUTHOR
IS THAT ACCESS TO ABN WILL ENHANCE RATHER THAN DIMINISH THE LONG-TERM ROLE OF
SUCH COOPERATIVES, ALTHOUGH SOME RATIONALISATION OF AUTONOMY AND INVESTMENT
UNDERTAKEN HITHERTO WILL BE NECESSARY.
