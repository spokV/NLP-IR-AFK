A STUDY OF INFORMATION CHANNELS IN TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION' THEIR ROLE IN
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION.
     
SUMMARY OF A BRAZILIAN DISSERTATION PRESENTED FOR A HIGHER DEGREE IN
INFORMATION SCIENCE, BASED CHIEFLY ON RECENT LITERATURE, BRAZILIAN AND
FOREIGN. THE STUDY COVERS THE PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION IN SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY; USER CHARACTERISTICS; THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TECHNOLOGICAL
INNOVATION AND INFORMATION CHANNELS; AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND INFORMATION
CHANNELS. THIS ANALYSIS OF THE PROCESS LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IN
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LABORATORIES, INFORMAL CHANNELS OF TECHNICAL
COMMUNICATION ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. PROPOSES WAYS IN WHICH RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT MANAGERS CAN MAXIMISE USE OF HUMAN RESOURCES THROUGH MANIPULATION
OF THE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS WITHIN THE ORGANISATION, THROUGH INVESTIGATION
OF THE EXISTING COMMUNICATION/INFORMATION ROLES AS INFORMATION PROCESSING
SYSTEMS. THESE ROLES CONSTITUTE THE TRUE AGENTS OF TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION ,
BOTH WITHIN THE ORGANISATION AND BETWEEN SEPARATE ORGANISATIONS. PARTICULAR
REFERENCE IS MADE TO RECENT BRAZILIAN RESEARCH.
