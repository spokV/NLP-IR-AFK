THE 5-YEARLY 2CENSUS OF LIBRARIES1, PUBLISHED BY THE NEW ZEALAND DEPARTMENT OF
STATISTICS, PROVIDES SO MUCH QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ON THE COUNTRY'S
LIBRARIES THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DIGEST AND INTERPRET. USING THE
1974 ISSUE (THE MOST RECENTLY PUBLISHED), SETS OUT A METHOD OF PRODUCING A
PROFILE (IN THE FORMAT OF A GRAPH) OF A PUBLIC LIBRARY, BASED ON 5 FACTORS
(POPULATION SERVED, TOTAL BOOK-STOCK, CIRCULATION, NUMBER OF FULL-TIME STAFF,
AND OPERATING EXPENDITURE). THIS PROFILE ENABLES COMPARISONS TO BE MADE OF THE
RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF SIMILAR LIBRARIES.
