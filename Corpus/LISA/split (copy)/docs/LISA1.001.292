THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

DESCRIBES AND PRESENTS THE FINDINGS OF THE URBAN INFORMATION SYSTEMS (URBIS)
PROJECT, CARRIED OUT IN 1973-78 BY THE URBIS RESEARCH GROUP OF THE PUBLIC
POLICY RESEARCH ORGANIZATION, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE. THE PROJECT'S
PURPOSE WAS TO ASSESS THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMPUTING,
EVALUATE ITS IMPACT ON GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND MANAGEMENT DECISION-MAKING, AND
DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE BETTER USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.
COMPUTING IN OVER 700 US CITIES AND COUNTIES WAS STUDIED EXTENSIVELY AND MORE
DETAILED INFORMATION WAS THEN COLLECTED IN 42 CITIES. IT WAS FOUND THAT
WELL-MANAGED COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY HAS REAL PAY-OFFS, BUT THAT IT WAS NOT
WELL-MANAGED IN MOST CITIES, CREATING PERVASIVE PROBLEMS AND PRODUCING
BENEFITS FAR SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS.
