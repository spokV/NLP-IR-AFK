DOCUMENTATION ARE CARRIED OUT IN 1 PROCESS BY MEANS OF MODERN TEXT PROCESSING
MACHINERY. THE PROCESS IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL; ABSTRACTS ARE RECORDED ON
MAGNETIC TAPES, WHOSE TEXTS ARE USED AS PRINTER'S COPY FOR A FORTNIGHTLY
ABSTRACTING JOURNAL. 150,000 ABSTRACTS ARE STORED AT PRESENT. THE TAPES ARE
THE BASIS OF INPUT, CODING AND RETRIEVAL. THE COWOCOR THESAURUS CONTAINS
75,000 TERMS INCLUDING SYNONYMS. THE CLASSIFICATION IS BASICALLY
MONOHIERARCHIC WITH ADDITIONAL POLYDIMENSIONS; THE TREATMENT OF SYNONYMS,
COMPOSITE TERMS AND HOMOGRAPHS IS DISCUSSED.
