TELETEXT SYSTEMS ARE APPROACHING WITH CAUTION.
     
COMMENTS ON THE REPORT BY THE TELETEXT COMMITTEE, SET UP IN 1978 BY THE PRIME
MINISTER'S OFFICE TO EXAMINE WHETHER THERE WAS ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR
INTRODUCING 1 OR MORE TELETEXT SYSTEMS IN DENMARK AND TO EVALUATE THE COSTS
INVOLVED. THE REPORT RECOMMENDS THE INTRODUCTION OF TEXT-TV, WHICH IS REGARDED
AS A USEFUL AND CHEAP MEANS OF TEXTING TV PROGRAMMES AND DISTRIBUTING GENERAL
INFORMATION. TELEDATA'S DIRECT CONNECTION TO DATA BASES WITH UNLIMITED
INFORMATION MAKES IT ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR INFORMATION SEARCHES. IT CAN ALSO
BE USED BY LIBRARIES FOR LOCATION OF BOOKS, LOAN INFORMATION, AND READERS'
ADVICE. OTHER USES INCLUDE' UPDATING OF REFERENCE WORKS AND ALL SOCIAL
INFORMATION OF A CHANGING NATURE' TIMETABLES, ADDRESS LISTS, ETC. HOWEVER,
TELEDATA IS VERY COSTLY AND DEMANDS A HIGH DEGREE OF ADAPTABILITY BY USERS.
ITS INTRODUCTION AS A PERMANENT PUBLIC SERVICE SHOULD THEREFORE AWAIT THE
RESULTS OF THE PLANNED EXPERIMENT EXPECTED IN 1983 AND SHO ULD ALSO BE
DISCUSSED BY THE MEDIA COMMISSION.
