THE GREAT INFO DANGER.

PRESENTS, IN THE PROFESSOR'S OWN WORDS, THE GLOOMY PREDICTION OF PROFESSOR
JOSEPH WEIZENBAUM (COMPUTER SCIENCE LECTURER AT MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF
TECHNOLOGY) THAT AN INFORMATION CATASTROPHE IS AHEAD. HE PAINTS A PICTURE OF
THE BLIND (COMPUTER SPECIALISTS) LEADING THE BLIND (COMPUTER USERS) THROUGH A
MINEFIELD OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY WHICH NOBODY UNDERSTANDS AND WHICH HAS ALREADY
SHOWN THAT IT IS CAPABLE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL ERRORS. COMPUTER SPECIALISTS
DO NOT UNDERSTAND MODERN COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND CANNOT PREDICT HOW THEY WILL
OPERATE. THEY CANNOT, THEREFORE, CONTROL THEM.
