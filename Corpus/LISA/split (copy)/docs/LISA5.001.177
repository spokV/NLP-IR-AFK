THE CULTURAL AND ARTISTIC HERITAGE IN LIBRARIES.

LECTURE GIVEN AT A MEETING OF THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF EAST GERMANY, JAN 81.
IN ORDER TO RECTIFY UNSUITABLE DIFFERENCES IN THE PROVISION OF THE GERMAN
LITERARY HERITAGE IN LIBRARIES OF VARIOUS SIZES, A LIST HAS BEEN PUBLISHED OF
RECOMMENDED STOCKS, ACCORDING TO LIBRARY SIZE, FROM THE MAIN WORKS OF 43
GERMAN WRITERS AND POETS FROM 1750 TO 1848. ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD CHECK
THEIR STOCKS AND TRANSFER MATERIAL TO PLACES WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED. TO
AROUSE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THIS PERIOD, LECTURES, READINGS AND EXHIBITIONS WILL
BE ORGANISED AND CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND COLLECTED WORKS PUBLISHED. IT MAY
BE POSSIBLE TO ATTRACT READERS THROUGH A GROWING INTEREST IN MODERN WRITERS.
