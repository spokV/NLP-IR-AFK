AUTOMATED ACQUISITIONS SYSTEMS' KEYNOTE ADDRESS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. LIBRARIANS SHOULD BE AWARE OF
THE RAPID PROGRESS BEING MADE TOWARD INTEGRATED SYSTEMS AND MAKE THE
ACQUISITIONS AUTOMATION DECISION IN THAT LIGHT. CONTRASTS THE MID-60S AND
EARLY 80S IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARY NEEDS. IN THE MID-60S, EMPHASIS
WAS ON ORDERING, AND TECHNOLOGY WAS LIMITING BOTH IN TERMS OF COSTS AND
CAPABILITIES. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 80S LIBRARIES HAVE NUMEROUS ACQUISITIONS
AVAILABLE, INCLUDING TURNKEY SYSTEMS FROM SOME CIRCULATION SYSTEM VENDORS AND
THE ACQUISITIONS SUBSYSTEMS OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES. IT IS UNLIKELY
THAT A SINGLE SOURCE WILL OFFER A LIBRARY THE MOST SUITABLE FEATURES FOR EACH
FUNCTION, AND THE PROBLEM BECOMES ONE OF INTEGRATING SYSTEMS FROM SEVERAL
SOURCES.
