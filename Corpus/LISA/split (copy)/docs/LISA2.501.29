DRAMATIC RISE IN THE NUMBER OF CENSORSHIP CASES.
     
INTERVIEWS JUDITH F. KRUG, LEADER OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S OFFICE
FOR INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM. ITS WORK IS BASED ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE U.S.
CONSTITUTION AND ON THE ALA'S LIBRARY BILL OF RIGHTS. IT BEGAN AS THE
INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM COMMITTEE IN 1940. UNTIL RECENTLY ALMOST ALL CASES CAME
FROM SCHOOL LIBRARIES, BUT SINCE THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE THE
MOST IMPORTANT CASES ORIGINATE WITH THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE OFFICE, HOWEVER,
DOES NOT CONFINE ITSELF TO TAKING UP CASES WITHIN THE LIBRARY SECTOR, BUT IT
KEEPS LIBRARIANS AND THE PUBLIC INFORMED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FIRST
AMENDMENT, ISSUES PUBLICATIONS, AND HOLDS SEMINARS. MANY ATTEMPTS AT
CENSORSHIP COME FROM THE MORAL MAJORITY MOVEMENT. THE OFFICE FINDS IT EASIER
TO DEAL WITH LIBRARIES WHICH HAVE A CLEARLY FORMULATED SELECTION POLICY, AND
IN VERY FEW CASES DOES IT RECOMMEND REFUSAL TO ACQUIRE A PARTICULAR BOOK. THE
LEGAL SIDE OF ALA IS DEALT WITH BY A SEPARATE,  BUT RELATED BODY, THE FREEDOM
TO READ FOUNDATION.
