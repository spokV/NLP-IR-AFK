THE LOSS FOR BUSINESS IS THE LIBRARY'S GAIN.
     
A PORTRAIT OF VISSENBJERG LIBRARY SERVICE, FUNEN, DENMARK WHICH HAS RECENTLY
ATTAINED FULL-TIME STATUS. THIS WAS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE SAVINGS INCURRED
WHEN THE LIBRARY, FORMERLY HOUSED IN A SCHOOL, BOUGHT SPACE IN A SHOPPING
CENTRE WHERE MANY SHOPS HAD HAD TO CLOSE. COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING METHODS WERE
USED TO ATTRACT READERS. THE LIBRARY IS NOW OPEN 20 HOURS A WEEK AND STAFF HAS
EXPANDED. THE DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN HELPED BY THE 2.4 MILLION KR. GRANT FROM
THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE, WHICH ALSO PARTLY COVERS RUNNING COSTS DURING THE
1ST 3 YEARS. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE LIBRARIAN, OLE HANSEN, THE PROBLEMS OF A
RAPIDLY GROWING READERSHIP WERE DISCUSSED. HE IS HOPEFUL THAT ACQUISITIONS
WILL KEEP PACE WITH LOANS. SEES THE LIBRARY AS A PLACE WHERE DEMOCRACY IS
NURTURED AND WHERE PEOPLE CAN MEET AND FEEL AT HOME. INTERVIEWS LOCAL
POLITICIANS, WHO ARE SATISFIED WITH THE LIBRARY'S LOCATION AND HOPE TO BE ABLE
TO PRESERVE THE 4 PART-TIME BRANCHES. INTER VIEWS 2 OF THE PART-TIME
LIBRARIANS, WHO ARE RELIEVED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS OF ACCOUNTING AND
BOOK SELECTION HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEM TO THE MAIN LIBRARY, BUT WOULD LIKE
TO IMPROVE SERVICES TO THE ELDERLY.
