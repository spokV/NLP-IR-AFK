NON-USE AND LOSER STUDIES IN COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION,
JULY 80. ARGUES THAT USE AND USER STUDIES HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED, OR
BEEN INFLUENTIAL IN LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE DO NOT YET
HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY SHOULD BE INTERPRETED.
SUGGESTS THAT AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELEVANT ASPECTS OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF THE
COMMUNITY IS ESSENTIAL TO THE DESIGN OF LIBRARY SERVICES, POLICIES AND GOALS,
AND TO THE MEANINGFUL INTERPRETATION OF STUDIES OF COLLECTION USE AND USER
PATTERNS. DESCRIBES BRIEFLY AN INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM FOR LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION
DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THIS.
