A DISTRIBUTED DATA ENTRY NETWORK FOR DATABASE PRODUCERS.
     
HAVING ENTRIES FOR A BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE PREPARED AT WIDELY SEPARATED
UNITS PRESENTS PROBLEMS OF LOGISTICS, COMMUNICATION, STANDARDISATION, CONTROL
AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS. CAB IS OVERCOMING THESE BY IMPLEMENTING THE
FORMATEXT-11 SOFTWARE PACKAGE ON A STAR NETWORK OF MINICOMPUTERS (PDP 11) AT
15 CENTRES IN THE UK. THE 1ST INSTALLATION OF THE NEW SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY
DEMONSTRATED ITS POTENTIAL FOR FAST, ACCURATE INPUT AT LOW COST. SPECIALLY
DESIGNED FOR PROCESSING STRUCTURED ALPHANUMERIC DATA, FORMATEXT-11 HAS
FACILITIES FOR FORMS DESIGN, AUTHORITY FILE DEFINITION AND MAINTENANCE,
CHARACTER SET DEFINITION, SOURCE TEXT ENTRY, PROOF PRINTING, RELEASING AND
DATA COMMUNICATIONS. THE EASE WITH WHICH THE 1ST 3 OF THESE FACILITIES CAN BE
MODIFIED MAKES FORMATEXT-11 A UNIQUELY FLEXIBLE TOOL FOR PRODUCERS OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES, DIRECTORIES, ENCYCLOPAEDIAS AND DICTIONARIES.
