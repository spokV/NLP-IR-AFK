WHY ENGINEERS DON'T USE DATABASES.

SHORTENED VERSION OF AN ARTICLE IN 2MECHANICAL ENGINEERING1 MAR 81. CLAIMS
THAT US ENGINEERS LARGELY IGNORE COMPUTERISED DATA BANKS AND USE DATED AND
LIMITED INFORMATION SOURCES. THEY COLLECT MOST OF THEIR ADVANCED TECHNICAL
INFORMATION THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH VENDORS, SALESMEN, CONSULTANTS, AND THEIR
PEERS AND RESTRICT THEIR FORMAL READING TO THE MATERIAL IN THE VICINITY OF
THEIR DESKS. THE CULPRIT IS THE INDEXING' THE MAJOR INDEXING SYSTEMS INDEX BY
SUBJECT OR THE NAME OF AN OBJECT, BUT AN ENGINEER WISHES TO RETRIEVE
INFORMATION INDEXED BY FUNCTION. ALSO, VITAL PRODUCT INFORMATION IS NOT
AVAILABLE ON A CREDITABLE DATA BASE.
