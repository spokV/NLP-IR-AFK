THE ETHICS OF FURTHER EDUCATION LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE LIBRARIAN'S 'CLIENTS' IN THE FURTHER EDUCATION SECTOR ARE IDENTIFIED. HIS
DUTIES TOWARDS THEM AND THE PROBLEMS RAISED BY THEM ARE DISCUSSED, WITH
SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE EDUCATION OF THE 16-19 AGE GROUP. THE NEED FOR THE
LIBRARIAN TO HOLD THEIR DIVERSE AND SOMETIMES CONFLICTING DEMANDS IN BALANCE
IS SEEN AS AN ASPECT OF HIS DUTIES THAT REQUIRES PROFESSIONAL AUTONOMY FOR ITS
SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE. THE NEED FOR A BALANCED USE OF THE FACILITIES,
COVERAGE OF SUBJECT AREAS, PROVISION FOR DIVERGENT VIEWS, AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF
FREE ENQUIRY LEADS TO THE SUGGESTION THAT TREATMENT RATHER THAN IDEAS IS WHAT
THE LIBRARIAN IS BEST QUALIFIED TO ASSESS. PORNOGRAPHY IS DISCUSSED IN
RELATION TO THIS AND OTHER CRITERIA. THE GROWTH OF OPEN LEARNING IS SEEN AS
DEMANDING A POSITIVE TUTORIAL APPROACH. THE NEED FOR MORAL COURAGE IS
AFFIRMED.
