DEVELOPMENT AID FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES-ADVISORY WORK AND SEMINARS IN THE
REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS.
     
IN MAY 81, FOR THE 1ST TIME, WEST GERMANY GAVE AID TO LIBRARIES IN A
DEVELOPING COUNTRY. IN CYPRUS, SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE USUALLY IN BETTER
CONDITION THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE CYPRIOT LIBRARIANS ASKED GERMANY FOR HELP
WITH PROBLEMS OF INSUFFICIENT QUALIFIED STAFF, OUTDATED AND INADEQUATE STOCKS,
SHORTAGE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE NEED TO INTEGRATE THE LIBRARY INTO THE SCHOOL
CURRICULUM. SEMINARS WERE ARRANGED TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISCUSSION AND
TO HELP LIBRARY STAFF TO REALISE THE SCHOOL LIBRARY'S EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL. A
REPORT WAS WRITTEN FOR THE DEUTSCHE GESELLSCHAFT FUR TECHNISCHE ZUSAMMENARBEIT
(THE GERMAN SOCIETY FOR TECHNICAL COOPERATION) CONTAINING SUGGESTIONS FOR
DEVELOPING SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND STAFF TRAINING WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF
NATIONAL LIBRARY PLANNING IN CYPRUS, WHICH IT IS HOPED WILL BE PUT TO
PRACTICAL USE.
