AND FOUNDED SCHOOLS. AN 11TH CENTURY CHRONICLE DESCRIBES THE 1ST RUSSIAN
LIBRARY'S CREATION, THE YAROSLAV LIBRARY, CONTAINING ABOUT 500 VOLUMES. OUR
ANCESTORS READ DEVOTIONAL BOOKS, LIVES OF THE SAINTS, ENCYCLOPAEDIC WORKS, AND
GEOGRAPHY. THE KIEVO-PECHERSKII MONASTERY IN KIEV HAD A LARGE COLLECTION OF
RUSSIAN AND GREEK BOOKS. A COLLECTION OF RYAZAN LITERATURE AT THE NIKOLA
CHURCH IN ZARAISK EVIDENCES THE WIDE DISSEMINATION OF CULTURE. HALF OF ALL
SURVIVING 11TH TO 14TH CENTURY RUSSIAN BOOKS COME FROM NOVGOROD. THE SOFIISKOI
CATHEDRAL LIBRARY IN NOVGOROD ATTRACTED MONKS FROM DISTANT RUSSIAN MONASTERIES
TO TRANSCRIBE THE BOOKS.
