THE FUTURE OF THE BOOK' A HISTORIAN'S PERSPECTIVE.
     
EXAMINES THE FUTURE OF THE BOOK IN THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY USING A HISTORICAL
APPROACH. ITS THESIS IS THAT THERE WILL BE BOTH CONTINUITY WITH THE PAST AND
BREAKS WITH TRADITION, AND THAT BOTH FORCES WILL IMPACT THE FUTURE LIBRARY. IT
DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN CUMULATIVE AND NONCUMULATIVE KNOWLEDGE AND BASIC AND
APPLIED RESEARCH AND CONCLUDES THAT KNOWLEDGE IN CERTAIN DISCIPLINES IS BEST
COMMUNICATED USING THE TRADITIONAL PRINT-ON-PAPER FORMAT, WHILE COMMUNICATION
OF KNOWLEDGE IN OTHER DISCIPLINES IS LIKELY TO INCORPORATE THE NEWER
TECHNOLOGIES.
