RETROSPECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCHING IN SPANISH HISTORY.

A PAPER PRESENTED AT A MADRID CONFERENCE IN 1981 TO DEMONSTRATE THE SPANISH
INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND
HUMANITIES (ISOC) APPROACH TO RETROSPECTIVE SEARCHING WHEN THE LITERATURE OF
THE SUBJECT IS MAINLY IN SPANISH. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE SPECIFIC SUBJECT
SELECTED, AND ITS SUITABILITY AS A SAMPLE TOPIC DISCUSSED, IN RELATION TO
GENERAL DIFFICULTIES FOR THE SEARCHER AND APPLICABILITY OF TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED
TO THE HUMANITIES FIELD IN GENERAL. RESULTS OBTAINED USING 4 DATA BASES AND 2
SPANISH INDEXES ARE PRESENTED AND ANALYSED IN TERMS OF OVERLAP, DATE OF
PUBLICATION, COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, AND TYPE OF PERIODICAL. IN CONCLUSION A
COMPARISON IS MADE SHOWING THE ADVANTAGES OF AUTOMATED OVER MANUAL SEARCHING.
A PROFILE OF THE TYPICAL ISOC USER IS PRESENTED, AND FINALLY RECOMMENDATIONS
ARE MADE CONCERNING USER TRAINING, PRICING OF SEARCH SERVICES, AND AUTOMATION
PROGRAMMES.
