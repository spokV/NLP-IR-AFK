AND COMMERCE.
     
A SMALL-SCALE EXPLORATORY STUDY OF SUB-OPTIMAL USAGE OF INDUSTRIAL AND
COMMERCIAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES WAS CARRIED OUT BY ASLIB IN SUMMER
80. NON-USE, MISUSE, AND ABUSE WERE EXAMINED FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF UNIT
MANAGERS. MAJOR AIMS WERE TO ASSESS THE REALITY, NATURE, AND EXTENT OF ANY
NON-USAGE PROBLEM AND THE FEASIBILITY AND USEFULNESS OF FURTHER INVESTIGATION.
