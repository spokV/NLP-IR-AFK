THE PREPARATORY COMMITTEE FOR UNCSTD: FOCUS ON INFORMATION.

REPORT ON THE FIFTH SESSION OF THE PREPARATORY COMMITTEE ON THE UNCSTD (UNITED
NATIONS CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT) DRAFT PROGRAMME
OF ACTION AND ESPECIALLY ITS DECISIONS REGARDING INFORMATION SERVICES. THERE
WAS EVIDENCE, PARTICULARLY AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, OF A GREAT NEED FOR
INFORMATION TO HELP IN THE ASSESSMENT AND APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DEVELOPMENT AND THERE WAS CLEARLY A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT EXISTING
INFORMATION FACILITIES. RECOMMENDATIONS CALLED ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO MAKE
THEIR INFORMATION RESOURCES MORE ACCESSIBLE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND CALLED
FOR AN INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE NETWORK. THE NETWORK WOULD MAKE FULL
USE OF EXISTING SPECIALISED INFORMATION NETWORKS AND CONSIST OF A SERIES OF
SUBNETWORKS IN EACH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
