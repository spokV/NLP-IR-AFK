SOME ASPECTS OF LIBRARY NETWORKING IN THE USA.
     
3 TYPES OF AMERICAN LIBRARY NETWORKS ARE DEFINED' ORGANISATIONAL, SPECIALISED
AND FUNCTIONAL. PUBLIC LIBRARIES BELONG TO THE FIRST GROUP, WHOSE PLANNING AND
DEVELOPMENT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE LIBRARIES. SPECIALISED NETWORKS
LINK TOGETHER SPECIAL LIBRARIES DEVOTED TO THE SAME SUBJECT DISCIPLINE
(NATIONWIDE NETWORKS OF MEDICAL OR AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIES BELONG TO THIS
GROUP). THE LAST TYPE BRINGS TOGETHER LIBRARIES WHOSE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS ARE
BASED ON THE USE OF THE SAME DATA BASE (E.G. OCLC). ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE
OF THE NETWORKS IS DISCUSSED TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHER ASPECTS INCLUDING
USERS, CENTRALISED CATALOGUING AND BOOK PROCESSING, LONG TERM PLANNING,
COORDINATED ACQUISITIONS, INTERLIBRARY LENDING AND COMPILATION OF UNION
CATALOGUES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
