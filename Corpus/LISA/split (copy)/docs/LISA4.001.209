AUTOMATED NETWORKS FOR CANADIAN SCI-TECH LIBRARIES: STILL AN ANOMALY?.
     
LOOKS AT THE STATE OF NETWORKING ACTIVITIES OF THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LIBRARIES OPERATING IN THE ACADEMIC, PRIVATE, AND PUBLIC DOMAINS OF CANADA. A
RECENT SURVEY SHOWED THESE LIBRARIES TO BE VERY INVOLVED WITH AUTOMATION AND
ENGAGED IN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE ENDEAVOURS, BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TO THE
LIBRARY'S ORGANISATION. HOWEVER, VERY FEW SCI-TECH LIBRARIES WERE FOUND TO BE
NETWORKING. SOME OF THE REASONS FOR THIS ARE GIVEN AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR
THE FUTURE ARE EXPLORED.
