AMERICAN ARCHIVAL THEORY' THE STATE OF THE ART.
     
CONCLUDES THAT AMERICAN ARCHIVAL THEORY DOES NOT EXIST AS A SYSTEMATICALLY
FORMULATED BODY OF IDEAS BUT IS AN AGGREGATION OF IDEAS DRAWN FROM WELL-TESTED
AND WIDELY ACCEPTED EUROPEAN ARCHIVAL PRINCIPLES AND OF PRAGMATIC CONCEPTS
DEVELOPED TO MEET SPECIAL NEEDS OF AMERICAN ARCHIVAL ADMINISTRATION AND
DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS.
