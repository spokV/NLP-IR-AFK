PAPER WAS ONE OF 3 WORKSHOPS DEVOTED TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF EDUCATION.
DISCUSSES THE CONCEPT OF MULTI-CULTURAL LIBRARY SERVICE, SUGGESTING THAT
COMMITMENT TO SUCH SERVICE BY ANY AUTHORITY MUST LOGICALLY EXTEND INTO AN
ANTI-RACIST POLICY. LANGUAGE, CLASS CULTURES, ACQUISITION OF MATERIALS, STOCK
SELECTION, DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF PROVISION, AND STAFF
ATTITUDES ARE ALL EXAMINED IN RELATION TO PROVISION OF A MULTI-CULTURAL
SERVICE.
