THE TRIER LIBRARY MODEL.
     
THE TRIER UNIVERSITY LIBRARY WAS OPENED IN AUTUMN 70 SHORTLY BEFORE THE
UNIVERSITY ITSELF. IT FACED MANY PROBLEMS FROM THE START AND THEY HAVE NOT YET
ALL BEEN SOLVED ALTHOUGH THE LIBRARY IS NOW OPERATING SUCCESSFULLY. IT IS RUN
AS AN INTEGRATED UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. THIS SYSTEM BROUGHT CONSIDERABLE
OPPOSITION FROM UNIVERSITY STAFF WHO PREFERRED TRADITIONAL INSTITUTE
LIBRARIES. THE LIBRARY IS IDEALLY CONSTRUCTED FOR ITS PURPOSE, AND TECHNICAL
FACILITIES, PRESENTATION AND CONTENT OF LIBRARY STOCK ARE ALSO SATISFACTORY.
THE PROBLEMS STILL EXISTING ARE CONNECTED TO THE UNIVERSITY LAWS CONCERNING
THE LIBRARY WHICH DO NOT GUARANTEE THE COMPETENCE OF THE LIBRARY DIRECTOR IN
LIBRARY MATTERS. THIS HAS LED TO INTERFERENCE IN LIBRARY AFFAIRS BY OTHER
UNIVERSITY BODIES AND DEMANDS FOR SPECIAL USER RIGHTS BY UNIVERSITY STAFF.
