CATALOGUES ON FILM.
     
DESCRIBES CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY'S AUTOMATION SYSTEM. IN 1974 THE LIBRARY
JOINED THE OCLC NETWORK AND TODAY ALL TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS ARE AUTOMATED. THE
USERS MEET AUTOMATION THROUGH THE COM CATALOGUE (COMPUTER OUTPUT MICROFILM), A
SYSTEM REGARDED AS MUCH CHEAPER THAN AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE. THERE WERE MANY
TEETHING TROUBLES INVOLVED IN THE INITIAL USE OF THE CATALOGUE, PARTICULARLY
IN THE BRANCH LIBRARIES, AND THE AUTOMATED ACQUISITION SYSTEM LED TO A VERY
TIGHT BUDGET CONTROL OVER THE BRANCHES. ALTHOUGH NEW EDITIONS OF THE COM
CATALOGUE TAKE LONGER TO ARRIVE THAN PROMISED IT HAS LED TO IMPROVED
INTERLENDING SERVICE. THE PUBLIC, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO USE THE OLD
DISCONTINUED CARD CATALOGUE AS, IT WAS CLAIMED, THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE
LIBRARY SERVICE'S TOTAL HOLDINGS, BUT ONLY IN THE STOCK OF THE LIBRARY BRANCH
USED. THE STAFF, TOO, DESPITE LACK OF ORGANISED OPPOSITION, EXPRESSED
CRITICISM OF THE AUTOMATION PROGRAMME.
