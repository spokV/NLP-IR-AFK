DUAL PRICING OF HEALTH SCIENCES PERIODICALS' A SURVEY.
     
A SURVEY OF DUAL PRICING PRACTICES AMONG PUBLISHERS OF HEALTH-RELATED JOURNALS
IDENTIFIED 281 PERIODICALS WITH AN AVERAGE PRICE DIFFERENTIAL OF OVER 100%
BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION RATES. BOTH THE PRACTICE
ITSELF AND THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL ARE INCREASING, INDICATING THAT
JOURNAL SUBSCRIPTIONS OF HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES INCREASINGLY PROVIDE THE
NECESSARY FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE PUBLICATION OF HEALTH SCIENCES JOURNALS.
DUAL PRICING IS ALSO CORRELATED WITH COPYRIGHT ROYALTIES. PROBLEMS CREATED FOR
HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES' BUDGETS BY DUAL PRICING ARE PARTLY DUE TO
UNCRITICAL PURCHASING BY LIBRARIES. RECOMMENDS INCREASED CONSUMERISM ON THE
PART OF HEALTH SCIENCE LIBRARIANS.
