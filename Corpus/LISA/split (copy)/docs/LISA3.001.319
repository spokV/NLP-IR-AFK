THE ISRAEL LEGAL DEPOSIT LAW (IN HEBREW).
     
IN 1953 THE LAW, ORIGINALLY PROMULGATED BY THE BRITISH MANDATORY GOVERNMENT,
WAS AMENDED. AS IT NOW STANDS, PUBLISHERS MUST DEPOSIT 5 COPIES OF EACH NEW
BOOK WITHIN 1 MONTH, AS FOLLOWS' 1 TO THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE, 1
IN THE ISRAEL STATE ARCHIVES, 1 IN THE KNESSET LIBRARY AND 2 IN THE JEWISH
NATIONAL AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY (JNUL). THE PRESENT LAW DOES NOT COVER
NON-BOOK MATERIAL; EDITIONS ARE NOT STRICTLY DEFINED; THERE IS NO WAY TO PROVE
DELINQUENCY IN DEPOSIT OF BOOKS DURING THE STATUTORY PERIOD OF 1 MONTH; THE
FINES ARE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO DETER PUBLISHERS; AND THE PROCEDURES FOR
INSTIGATING LEGAL ACTION ARE IN THEMSELVES A DETERRENT AGAINST SUCH ACTION.
OUTLINES THE STEPS TAKEN BY THE JNUL TO ENCOURAGE PUBLISHERS TO COMPLY WITH
THE LAW, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT AS MANY BOOKS AS POSSIBLE ARE DEPOSITED UNTIL
THE LAW CAN BE AMENDED.
