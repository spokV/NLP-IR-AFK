DO LIBRARIES HAVE POLITICAL DUTIES?.
     
MANY TASKS UNDERTAKEN BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE POLITICAL, NOT BECAUSE THEY
PROMOTE PARTY POLITICS BUT BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE ENLIGHTENMENT AND PLEASURE FOR
EACH INDIVIDUAL IN A FREE DEMOCRACY. CULTURE INVOLVES NOT ONLY BEAUTY BUT ALSO
SOCIAL REALITY. LIBRARIANS MUST HELP ALL HANDICAPPED PEOPLE; GERMANY IS AHEAD
OF FRANCE IN LIBRARY WORK WITH THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED AND PROVISION OF
LIBRARY FACILITIES FOR FOREIGN WORKERS CERTAINLY INVOLVES BOTH CULTURE AND
POLITICS. THE LIBRARIES MUST PROMOTE READING, OR BOOKS MAY BE OUSTED BY
AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA. STOCK SELECTION CRITERIA MUST BE THOSE OF TRUTH AND
OBJECTIVITY; THE LIBRARIAN MUST BE MINDFUL OF ALL VIEWPOINTS, SINCE FREEDOM
PERMITS OPPOSITION.
