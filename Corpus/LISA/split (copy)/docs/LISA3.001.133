MICROFILM CONVERSION IN AN ACADEMIC PHYSICS LIBRARY.
     
DISCUSSES THE CONVERSION OF MODERATELY-USED PHYSICS JOURNALS FROM HARD COPY TO
ROLL MICROFILM AT THE PHYSICS LIBRARY, UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA AT MINNEAPOLIS.
DESPITE INITIAL AND PRE-CONVERSION USER RESISTANCE, CONCLUSIONS BASED ON
MONITORING THE USE OF THE FILMED TITLES SUGGESTS THAT MOST
NON-INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNALS MORE THAN 10 YEARS OLD CAN BE CONVERTED AS LONG
AS GOOD QUALITY POSITIVE PRINTS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE RESEARCHER.
