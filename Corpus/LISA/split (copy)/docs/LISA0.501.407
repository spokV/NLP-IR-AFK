VIEWDATA DEAF-AID.

THIS BRIEF REVIEW DESCRIBES AN EXPERIMENT SET UP BY THE ROYAL NATIONAL
INSTITUTE FOR THE DEAF, BRITISH TELECOM AND THE NATIONAL RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT
CORPORATION (NRDC). THE EXPERIMENT INVOLVES 25 DEAF PEOPLE WITH A GOOD COMMAND
OF SPEECH AND EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITIES OF HOLDING TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS
WITH HEARING FRIENDS VIA A 'VOICE BUREAU'. NRDC EQUIPMENT, CALLED PALANTYPE,
IS USED AND THIS ALLOWS THE OPERATOR TO TYPE OUT THE SPOKEN WORD ONTO A
PRESTEL-TYPE TV SCREEN, THUS ENABLING THE DEAF PERSON TO SEE THE
'CONVERSATION'. EVEN IF TRIALS ARE SUCCESSFUL, HOWEVER, A GENERAL SERVICE WILL
ONLY BE ENVISAGED IF HIGH OPERATIONAL COSTS CAN BE OVERCOME.
