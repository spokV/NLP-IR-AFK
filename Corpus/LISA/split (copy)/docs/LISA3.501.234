ARIADNE'S THREAD THROUGH THE LABYRINTH OF BOOKS.
     
SIGNS, TAPE/SLIDE PERFORMANCES, PRINTED GUIDES, AND GUIDED TOURS-THESE WERE
THE INFORMATION MEDIA RE-DESIGNED AT THE FRANKFURT CITY AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
IN THE COURSE OF A PROJECT FOR IMPROVING ITS USER EDUCATION PROGRAMME. DEALS
WITH THE SIGNAGE SYSTEM. AFTER SHOWING THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF SIGNS IN
LIBRARIES PRACTICAL PROBLEMS ARE DISCUSSED. PARTICULAR STRESS IS LAID UPON THE
NECESSITY OF COOPERATING WITH A DESIGN CONSULTANT AND THE USE OF COLOUR AND
SYMBOL SIGNS. A SIGNAGE SYSTEM IS SUGGESTED WHICH IS GRADED IN PROPORTION TO
THE READER'S CAPACITY OF RECEIVING AND DIGESTING ANY GIVEN INFORMATION.
