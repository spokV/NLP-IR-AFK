HOW TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE READERS' WORK IN THE LIBRARY.
     
AN IMPORTANT TASK OF THE 5-YEAR-PLAN IS TO SAVE READERS' EXPENDITURE OF EFFORT
IN USING LIBRARIES. COMPUTERISED CATALOGUES SHOW WIDE POTENTIAL. READERS'
REQUESTS ARE TRANSMITTED TO LARGE LIBRARIES' BOOKSTORES ALONG T.V.
COMMUNICATION CHANNELS. DOCUMENT REPRODUCTION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESSENED
READERS' EXPENDITURE OF EFFORT. AUTOMATION OF ACQUISITIONING, CATALOGUING,
INTERLIBRARY LOANS, SELECTIVE RETRIEVAL ALSO SAVE READERS' TIME. LARGE
LIBRARIES HAVE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FOR ISSUING BIBLIOGRAPHIES, ABSTRACTS, UNION
CATALOGUES. LARGE INFORMATION-COMPUTER CENTRES WILL BE CREATED FOR COLLECTIVE
USE AS INFORMATION TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS. THE STATE AUTOMATED SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SHOULD ECONOMISE ON LIBRARIANS' AND READERS'
TIME' THE GOVERNING FACTORS IN LIBRARY AUTOMATION.
