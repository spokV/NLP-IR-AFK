BETTER EDUCATION IN IMMIGRANT MATTERS FOR LIBRARIANS IS WANTED.
     
TRADITIONAL LIBRARY ACTIVITIES FOR ESTABLISHED USER GROUPS ARE STILL THE NORM
IN SWEDISH LIBRARIES, AND IMMIGRANT SERVICES ARE CARRIED OUT AS HUMANITARIAN
AID WITH CONSEQUENT LOW STATUS. IF DEMAND FOR IMMIGRANT LITERATURE WERE
TREATED LIKE THAT FOR COOK BOOKS OR STAMP CATALOGUES A LESS EMOTIONAL ATTITUDE
WOULD BE ACHIEVED. LIBRARIES MUST HELP IMMIGRANTS TO RETAIN THEIR MOTHER
TONGUE AS WELL AS TO LEARN SWEDISH. THERE ARE GOVERNMENTAL GUIDELINES ON
STOCKING OF IMMIGRANT LITERATURE AND CHANNELS OF SUPPLY ARE AVAILABLE, BUT
COORDINATION OF ACQUISITION AND CATALOGUING IS NEEDED. MORE CONTACT WITH
IMMIGRANT ORGANISATIONS AND BETTER EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS ARE NECESSARY. WHAT
HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE IS LARGELY DUE TO THE WORK OF THE SWEDISH LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION'S WORKING PARTY ON IMMIGRANT AND MINORITY QUESTIONS.
