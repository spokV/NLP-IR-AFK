ANCIENT BULGARIAN MANUSCRIPTS.
     
IN THE COURSE OF BULGARIA'S TURBULENT HISTORY, MUCH OF HER NATIONAL LITERARY
HERITAGE WAS DESTROYED. THERE ARE ALSO NUMEROUS ITEMS WHICH ENRICH THE
COLLECTIONS OF LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS ABROAD. IN SPITE OF THAT THE COLLECTIONS
OF ANCIENT MANUSCRIPTS IN BULGARIA TODAY ARE STILL AN INVALUABLE SOURCE OF
RESEARCH. SCHOLARS WHEN STUDYING THE LAVISH ILLUMINATIONS, FIND NOT ONLY NEW
INFORMATION ON THE NATIONAL LITERARY AND CULTURAL HISTORY, BUT ALSO ON THE
ARTS. NOWADAYS, THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA PROUDLY
POSSESSES THE LARGER COLLECTIONS OF ANCIENT MANUSCRIPTS REACHING 1400 ITEMS.
THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES' CENTRAL LIBRARY, THE LIBRARY AT THE RILSKIJ MONASTERY
NATIONAL MUSEUM, THE IVAN VAZOV NATIONAL LIBRARY IN PLOVDIV, THE REGIONAL
HISTORIC MUSEUM AT VELIKO TURNOVO, AS WELL AS SOME OTHERS ALSO HAVE
COLLECTIONS. LIBRARIANS AND MUSEUMS' STAFF MUST DO THEIR BEST TO PROVIDE
PROPER CATALOGUING, AS FOR INSTANCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOFIA, IN ORDER TO
MAKE THE ANCIENT MANUSCRIPTS AVAILABLE BOTH TO RESEARCH WORKERS AND THE
GENERAL PUBLIC.
