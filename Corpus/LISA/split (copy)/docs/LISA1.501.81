HOW SHALL THE LIBRARY APPROACH THE IMMIGRANTS?.
     
THE LIBRARY SERVICES TO IMMIGRANTS IN DENMARK ARE GOVERNED BY THE GENERAL RULE
OF EQUAL ACCESS TO LIBRARY SERVICES. FOR PRACTICAL REASONS, THIS MEANS THAT
PART OF THE SERVICE MUST BE CENTRALISED, VIZ. SELECTION, ACQUISITION AND
PREPARATION OF THE MATERIAL. GENTOFTE PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS SINCE 1970 HAD A
CENTRAL COLLECTION OF IMMIGRANT LITERATURE AVAILABLE TO OTHER LIBRARIES. THE
CHOICE OF MATERIAL MUST BE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH PEOPLE KNOWLEDGEABLE
ABOUT THE GROUPS AND THEIR CONDITIONS IN THE NEW COUNTRY. THE SELECTION MUST
ALSO REFLECT THE NEED, NOT ONLY FOR FICTIONAL, BUT ALSO FOR INFORMATIVE
LITERATURE BOTH ABOUT THE HOMELAND AND THE ADOPTED COUNTRY. MORE AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIAL AND A BETTER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM ARE NECESSARY. THE EFFORTS OF THE
LOCAL LIBRARY CATERING FOR VERY SMALL GROUPS OF IMMIGRANTS MUST, APART FROM
COLLECTIONS OF REFERENCE WORKS AND CLASSICS, BE CONCENTRATED ON CONTACT WORK
AND CULTURAL ARRANGEMENTS.
