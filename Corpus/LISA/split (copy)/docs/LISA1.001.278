A PRELIMINARY DESIGN IS GIVEN; (2) A COMPUTER-BASED INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR
CURRENT AWARENESS SERVICES AND RETROSPECTIVE SEARCHING; (3) COMPUTER-AIDED
PREPARATION OF REGIONAL OR NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TOOLS; AND (4) MODERN
REPROGRAPHY EQUIPMENT AT CENTRAL LOCATIONS TO HELP WITH DOCUMENT DELIVERY
NEEDS.
