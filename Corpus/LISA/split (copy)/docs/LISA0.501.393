HOME VIDEOTEX SERVICES' SOME LEGAL ISSUES.

REVISED VERSION OF PAPER PRESENTED AT A CONFERENCE, NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN
CANADIAN COMMUNICATIONS LAW AND POLICY, OTTAWA, JAN 80. THE PROVISION OF
VIDEOTEX SERVICES RAISES INTERESTING LEGAL ISSUES. THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK OF
REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO RADIO, TELEVISION, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS WILL
LIKELY APPLY TO VIDEOTEX, ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT TRANSMISSION MECHANISMS MAY WELL
BE REGULATED DIFFERENTLY. IT IS UNCERTAIN IF THE COPYRIGHT LAW IN CANADA
COVERS INFORMATION STORED IN COMPUTERS SUCH AS THAT WHICH WOULD BE CONTAINED
IN A VIDEOTEX SYSTEM. VIDEOTEX SERVICES ORIGINATING OUTSIDE CANADA WOULD BE
ABLE TO SIDESTEP CANADIAN PRIORITIES AND CANADIAN LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS. IT
HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT A WAY OF DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM WOULD BE TO REGULATE
THE FLOW OF DATA ACROSS NATIONAL BORDERS.
