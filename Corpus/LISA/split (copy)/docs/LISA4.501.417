AN AUTOMATIC METHOD FOR EXTRACTING SIGNIFICANT PHRASES IN SCIENTIFIC OR
TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS.
     
THIS METHOD IS BASED ON TEXT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS AND USES A RELATIVELY SMALL
DICTIONARY. THE DICTIONARY IS BASED ON KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNOLOGICAL CONCEPTS AND ON SOME LEXICAL KNOWLEDGE. TEXT ANALYSIS IS USED TO
SELECT SIGNIFICANT PHRASES AS SUBSTANTIAL AND SEMANTIC INFORMATION CARRIERS OF
THE CONTENTS OF THE ABSTRACT. RESULTS OF AN EXPERIMENT ON 5 SETS OF DOCUMENTS
INDICATE THAT SIGNIFICANT PHRASES ARE EFFECTIVELY EXTRACTED WITHIN A
SATISFACTORY PROCESSING TIME.
