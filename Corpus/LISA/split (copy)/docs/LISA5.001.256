GHANA AND UAP' OBSTACLES AND PROSPECTS.

SINCE INDEPENDENCE, GHANA'S BOOK INDUSTRY HAS RECEIVED A GREAT DEAL OF
ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE STATE TO DEVELOP A VIABLE MODERN INDIGENOUS
INFRASTRUCTURE. ITS PROGRESS HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY DETERIORATING ECONOMIC AND
OTHER FACTORS. LOW LITERACY IS SLOWING DOWN THE SPREAD OF THE BOOK CULTURE,
AND COMBINED WITH OBSTRUCTIVE INDIFFERENCE OF OFFICIALS, ACCESS TO AND
AVAILABILITY OF INDIGENOUS PUBLICATIONS ARE PROVING DIFFICULT. LIBRARIES ARE
FACING ENORMOUS OBSTACLES IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION. ACTION
AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS IS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO THE
PROMOTION OF UAP (UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS).
