THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN FRANCE. ITS ACTUAL SITUATION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS.
     
A COMPREHENSIVE AND CRITICAL SURVEY ARGUING THE URGENT NEED TO PROVIDE EQUAL
LEVELS OF SERVICE FOR BOTH URBAN AND RURAL USERS. IN GENERAL, THE PUBLIC SEES
LIBRARIES AS OUT OF DATE, UNDER-RESOURCED, AND UNATTRACTIVE, AND IS LARGELY
UNAWARE OF RECENT NEW DEVELOPMENTS BECAUSE THESE ARE RESTRICTED TO A FEW
CENTRES OF EXCELLENCE. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SHOULD PROVIDE FREE COMPREHENSIVE
SERVICES FOR ALL' DESCRIBES THESE SERVICES IN DETAIL, AS THEY RELATE TO
DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION, AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES. THE DIVISION OF
LIBRARY SERVICES INTO URBAN AND RURAL STRUCTURES HAS RESULTED IN INADEQUATE
SERVICES FOR COUNTRY AREAS; INSTEAD, THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE REORGANISED INTO A
NETWORK PATTERN TO EQUALISE DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES. CRITICISMS OF MUNICIPAL
LIBRARIES, CENTRAL LENDING LIBRARIES, AND THE FRENCH PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE IN
GENERAL ARE SUMMARISED IN AN APPENDED MEMORANDUM, AND FURTHER ILLUSTRATED BY
AN ANALYSIS OF THE ORGANISATION OF SERVICES IN THE CAMBRAI REGION.
