QUERY LANGUAGE.
     
DESCRIBES A PROJECT ON INFORMAL (NATURAL)/FORMAL (DATA BASE QUERY) LANGUAGE
MAPPING. A BASIS WAS DEVELOPED FOR PROCESSING ENGLISH-LANGUAGE REQUESTS FOR

ROLE OF EACH WORD IN THE NATURAL-LANGUAGE QUERY WAS IDENTIFIED BY 2 SEPARATE
METHODS-A LEARNING ALGORITHM AND A STATISTICAL TECHNIQUE. THE PROGRAMME WAS
RUN WITH A SET OF 400 SENTENCES FROM A BASIC SCIENCE BOOK. THE RESULTS, WHICH
