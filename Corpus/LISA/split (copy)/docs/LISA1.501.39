JEWETT'S ROLE IN THE NATIONAL LIBRARY FOR THE USA.
     
IN 1835, THE USA RECEIVED A BEQUEST UNDER THE WILL OF JAMES SMITHSON (A UK
CHEMIST) FOR FOUNDING IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AN ESTABLISHMENT 'FOR THE INCREASE
AND DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE AMONG MEN'. FOLLOWS THE DISCUSSIONS IN CONGRESS
LEADING TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION ORGANISING ACT IN
1844, ITS SIGNING IN 1846, AND THE WORK OF THE SMITHSONIAN BOARD OF REGENTS
WHICH PLANNED THE COLLECTION. FOCUSES ON CHARLES COFFIN JEWETT'S ROLE IN
ESTABLISHING THE COLLECTION; HIS DESIRE TO MAKE IT A FOCAL POINT FOR US
RESEARCH; HIS CAMPAIGN FOR A NATIONAL LIBRARY; AND HIS DREAM OF A NATIONAL
UNION CATALOGUE. REPRODUCES HIS 1ST ANNUAL REPORT TO THE BOARD OF REGENTS,
1848 (HE WAS ASSISTANT SECRETARY), IN WHICH HE PRESENTS AND EXPLAINS HIS
BELIEFS AND DESIRES.
