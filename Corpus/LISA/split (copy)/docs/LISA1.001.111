ACCESS TO PATENT INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION IN PUBLIC PATENT LIBRARIES.

SUMMARISES THE RESULTS OF A 1980 STUDY MADE FOR THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES. THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO STUDY THE ORGANISATION OF PUBLIC PATENT
LIBRARIES AND ON THIS BASIS (SUPPLEMENTED WITH INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERTS) TO
DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF ACCESS TO MATERIAL IN SUCH
LIBRARIES. THE PATENT OFFICES OF WEST GERMANY AND FRANCE, EUROPEAN PATENT
OFFICE, SCIENCE REFERENCE LIBRARY IN LONDON, AND PATENT LIBRARIES OR
INFORMATION CENTRES IN NUREMBERG, LIVERPOOL, LYON, STRASBOURG, AND TOULOUSE
WERE VISITED. THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM AREAS IDENTIFIED WERE IDENTIFICATION
OF USER'S NEEDS, EXTENT OF DOCUMENTATION NEEDED, PUBLICITY PROGRAMMES,
LOCATION OF PATENT INFORMATION CENTRES, AND ORGANISATION AND STAFFING OF SUCH
CENTRES.
