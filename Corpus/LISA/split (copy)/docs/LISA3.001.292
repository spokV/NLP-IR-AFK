SECONDARY SERVICES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES' THE NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT AND THE
ROLE OF LIBRARIANS.
     
RESEARCH BASED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BATH, UK, DURING 1967-75 (INCLUDING THE
INVESTIGATION INTO INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES (INFROSS)
AND DESIGN OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES (DISISS) PROJECTS)
SHOWED INDEXING AND ABSTRACTING SERVICES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES TO BE
NUMEROUS, UNCOORDINATED, OFTEN POORLY DESIGNED, AND GREATLY UNDERUSED.
OBSTACLES TO IMPROVEMENT INCLUDE THE NON-COMMERCIAL NATURE OF MANY SERVICES,
RELATIVELY SMALL AND POOR MARKET, MAIN BUYERS (LIBRARIES) NOT BEING THE USERS,
AND GENERALLY LITTLE INCENTIVE. IN THE LONG TERM, A TOTALLY AUTOMATED SYSTEM
COULD BE THE SOLUTION. MEANWHILE, LIBRARIES CAN IMPROVE THE SITUATION BY
CONDUCTING EVALUATION STUDIES, CANCELLING POOR SERVICES, PRESSING FOR THE
IMPROVEMENT OF GOOD SERVICES, AND ENCOURAGING USERS TO BE MORE DEMANDING.
