APPROACHES TO FORECASTING DEMANDS FOR LIBRARY NETWORK SERVICES.
     
THE PROBLEM OF FORECASTING MONTHLY DEMANDS FOR LIBRARY NETWORK SERVICES IS
CONSIDERED, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF USING FORECASTS AS INPUTS TO POLICY
ANALYSIS MODELS AND IN TERMS OF THE USE OF FORECASTS AS AN AID TO BUDGETING
AND STAFFING DECISIONS. FORECASTING METHODS CONSIDERED INCLUDE BOX-JENKINS
TIME-SERIES METHODOLOGY, ADAPTIVE FILTERING, AND LINEAR REGRESSION. USING
DEMAND DATA FROM THE ILLINOIS LIBRARY AND INFORMATION NETWORK FOR 1971-78, IT
IS SHOWN THAT FADING-MEMORY REGRESSION IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE METHOD, IN
TERMS OF BOTH ACCURACY AND EASE OF USE.
