AFTER FIVE YEARS' AN ASSESSMENT OF THE AMENDED U.S. FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT.
     
ASSESSMENT OF THE ACT WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR
ARCHIVISTS, SUGGESTING THAT WHILST THE ACT IS WORKING, IT RELEASES SOME OF THE
INFORMATION AGENCIES WOULD LIKE TO WITHHOLD AND WITHOLDS SOME INFORMATION THAT
REQUESTERS WOULD LIKE RELEASED. OVERALL, IT PROBABLY STRIKES A BALANCE. A
CONTINUING CHALLENGE IN THE 1980S IS THE STATEMENT OF RECORDS BY ARCHIVISTS SO
THAT EVERYONE-AGENCIES, RESEARCHERS, LAWYERS, AND EVEN JUDGES-WILL UNDERSTAND
IT.
