EDUCATION FOR INFORMATION INTERMEDIARIES. AN EXAMPLE FROM THE SCHOOL OF
INFORMATION STUDIES, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY, N.Y.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
WORK. THROUGH A SWEDISH AMERICAN FOUNDATION SCHOLARSHIP, THE AUTHOR SPENT A
YEAR AT THE SCHOOL OF INFORMATION STUDIES, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK
STATE. PRESENTS BRIEFLY PERSONAL IMPRESSIONS OF COURSES ON MANAGEMENT,
AUTOMATION, INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, AND INTERPERSONAL
COMMUNICATIONS/INFORMATION TRANSFER. SUGGESTS A NEED FOR MORE EMPHASIS ON
COURSES IN MARKETING INFORMATION SERVICES AND IN DEFINING INFORMATION PROBLEMS
AND SEARCH QUESTIONS. CONCLUDES THAT SUCH ESTABLISHMENTS SHOULD FOLLOW CLOSELY
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PROFESSION AND ADAPT THEIR COURSES ACCORDINGLY.
