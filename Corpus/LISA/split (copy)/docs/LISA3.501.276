USE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE IN CEREALS RESEARCH.
     
THE USE AND EFFECT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE ON CEREALS RESEARCH IN
NIGERIA WAS DETERMINED BY USING A MULTI-METHOD APPROACH. ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND
INDIGENOUS AFRICAN LANGUAGE LITERATURE WAS EXCLUDED. LANGUAGES INCLUDED WERE
FRENCH, GERMAN, SPANISH, RUSSIAN, JAPANESE AND CHINESE. METHODS USED IN THE
SURVEY WERE A TWO-YEAR ANALYSIS OF THE LOANS RECORDS OF THE NATIONAL CEREALS
RESEARCH INSTITUTE LIBRARY, QUESTIONNAIRES DISTRIBUTED TO RESEARCH SCIENTISTS
AND ANALYSES OF THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE REFERENCES IN RECENT PUBLICATIONS AND
THESES OF THE SCIENTISTS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT SCIENTISTS MAKE LITTLE USE OF
FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE BECAUSE FEW OF THEM ARE ABLE TO READ THESE
LANGUAGES. CONSEQUENTLY SCIENTISTS ARE MISSING IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND THERE
IS DUPLICATION OF RESEARCH WHICH USE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE COULD
MINIMISE. RESULTS ALSO SHOWED THAT FRENCH, GERMAN, CHINESE AND JAPANESE ARE
IMPORTANT IN CEREALS RESEARCH.
