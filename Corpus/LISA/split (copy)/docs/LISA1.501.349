DISINFECTION AND STRAIGHTENING OF PARCHMENT DAMAGED BY MICROORGANISMS.
     
BACTERIA AND MICELLAR FUNGI WERE ISOLATED FROM DAMAGED PARTS OF ANCIENT
MANUSCRIPTS ON PARCHMENT AND INVESTIGATED. CATAMIN AB (ALREADY USED AS A
DISINFECTANT FOR PAINTINGS) WAS FOUND TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ANTISEPTIC
AGENT AGAINST THESE PARCHMENT-DESTROYING MICROORGANISMS AND A DISINFECTING
TECHNIQUE INCORPORATING THE STRAIGHTENING OF DEFORMED PARCHMENTS WAS
DEVELOPED. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT CATAMIN AB HAS NO DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT ON THE
PHYSICO-MECHANICAL AND PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF PARCHMENT.
