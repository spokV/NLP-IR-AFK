AUTOMATION OF TEST-DATA TRANSMISSION FROM PRODUCER TO COMPUTER MASTER FILE.
     
DESCRIBES 2 METHODS FOR THE DIRECT INPUT OF DATA OBTAINED DURING SCIENTIFIC
EXPERIMENTS INTO A COMPUTER TERMINAL, ALL FURTHER DATA MANIPULATION AND
PROCESSING BEING CONTROLLED BY COMPUTER PROGRAMS' (1) DIRECT RECORDING OF
OBSERVATIONS (E.G. PLANT GROWTH) ON A PORTABLE BATTERY-POWERED RECORDING
DEVICE, FOLLOWED BY DATA TRANSMISSION TO THE COMPUTER AND (2) CRT ENTRY OF
OBSERVED VALUES FOR TEST AND CONTROL ANIMALS FOR SPECIFIC TESTS. ONLY AFTER
VERIFICATION OF DATA ACCURACY BY THE INFORMATION PRODUCER ARE THE RESULTS
ENTERED INTO THE MASTER DATA BASE. IN THE EXPERIMENTS DESCRIBED, THE ABBOTT
AUTOMATED BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL DATA SYSTEM (ABCD) WAS USED.
