THE RESOLUTION POWER OF MICROFILMS (IN CHINESE).
     
IN ORDER TO HAVE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INFLUENCE OF RESOLUTION POWER
ON MICROFILMS, DESCRIBES THE DETERMINING METHODS OF RESOLUTION POWER FOR FILM
MANUFACTURING AND USER'S APPLICATION. THE EXPRESSION OF RESOLUTION POWER BY
LINES PER MIN IS SOMETIMES CONFUSING, SO THE METHOD READABLE BY THE PATTERN
FROM THE NBS RESOLUTION TEST CHART 1010A REGARDLESS OF THE REDUCTION RATIO HAS
BEEN INTRODUCED. FURTHERMORE, USING THE QUALITY INDEX CHART, IT IS POSSIBLE TO
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RESOLUTION POWER REQUIRED TO MICROFILM
THE ORIGINALS CONTAINING ONLY ROMANIC LETTERS AND THOSE CONTAINING CHINESE
CHARACTERS, WHICH ARE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED IN STRUCTURE.
