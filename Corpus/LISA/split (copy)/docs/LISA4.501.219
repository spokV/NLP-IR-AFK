THE SACRED COW' LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN.
     
ARGUES THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE TO CHILDREN IN THE UK SUFFERS FROM THE 2
ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURES WHICH CHARACTERISE ITS PROVISION. 1 STRUCTURE SEPARATES
WORK WITH CHILDREN COMPLETELY FROM WORK WITH ADULTS, AND REGARDS IT AS THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF SPECIALISTS' THE OTHER ASSUMES, IN CONTRAST, THAT CHILDREN
HAVE NO SPECIFIC NEEDS, AND STAFF NEED NO TRAINING IN DEALING WITH THEM.
ADVOCATES A STRUCTURE IN WHICH THE EXECUTION OF CHILDREN'S WORK IS THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMMUNITY LIBRARY STAFF, TRAINED AND SUPPORTED BY
SPECIALISTS.
