EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS BETWEEN YUGOSLAV AND SOVIET LIBRARIES AS A FACTOR OF
CULTURAL COOPERATION.
     
THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO FIND OUT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE EXCHANGE OF
PUBLICATIONS BETWEEN YUGOSLAV NATIONAL LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIES IN THE USSR. 8
NATIONAL LIBRARIES PARTICIPATED IN THE SURVEY, THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE
ANALYSED. AMONG THE ASPECTS COVERED WERE' THE SOVIET EXCHANGE PARTNERS,
SUBJECTS OF PUBLICATIONS EXCHANGED (THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE IS THAT OF
LIBRARIANSHIP LITERATURE FOLLOWED BY HISTORIOGRAPHY, ARTS AND PHILOLOGY,
ESPECIALLY SLAVISTICS), AND THE PROPORTION OF EXCHANGES IN RELATION TO THE
PURCHASES. ALTHOUGH IN MOST YUGOSLAV LIBRARIES EXCHANGES ARE CARRIED OUT
SYSTEMATICALLY ACCORDING TO A PLAN AND WITH REGARD TO THE NEEDS OF EACH
LIBRARY, THERE IS A SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE WAY OF COORDINATION ON THE
NATIONAL LEVEL.
