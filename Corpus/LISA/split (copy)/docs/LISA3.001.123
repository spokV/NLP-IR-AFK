EVALUATION OF REFERENCE COLLECTIONS IN PUBLIC, COMMUNITY COLLEGE, AND HIGH
SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
     
BRIEFLY REVIEWS THE LITERATURE RELATING TO THE EVALUATION OF REFERENCE
COLLECTIONS IN PUBLIC, COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARIES, AND
COMPARES THE VIEWS OF A SAMPLE OF US LIBRARIANS IN THESE 3 TYPES OF LIBRARIES
ON THIS EVALUATION. CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS A GAP NOT ONLY BETWEEN WHAT HAS
BEEN REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE CONCERNING EVALUATION OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS
AND THE ACTUAL WORLD OF LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS, BUT ALSO BETWEEN WHAT
LIBRARIANS FEEL IS IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE ABOUT EVALUATION, AND WHAT THEY ARE
ACTUALLY DOING IN THEIR LIBRARIES.
