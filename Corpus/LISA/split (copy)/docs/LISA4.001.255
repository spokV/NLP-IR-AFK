COOPERATION BETWEEN THE LIBRARY AND THE STEI (SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND
ECONOMIC INFORMATION) SYSTEMS WITHIN THE REGION. CAN IT BE PUT INTO PRACTICE?.
     
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE LIBRARY AND THE STEI SYSTEMS WITHIN A REGION IS A LONG
STANDING PROBLEM, THE AIM OF WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PARAMOUNT RIGHT OF THE
READER TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL AVAILABLE LITERATURE SOURCES. ALTHOUGH THE
MINISTRY OF CULTURE TOGETHER WITH THE CZECHOSLOVAK STATE LIBRARY PUBLISHED IN
1974 'PRINCIPLES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIFIED LIBRARY SYSTEM IN THE
CZECHOSLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC', IT REMAINED ONLY METHODOLOGICAL ADVICE.
THERE IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH COOPERATION. THE SPHERES IN WHICH THIS SHOULD BE
STARTED ARE CONSIDERED.
