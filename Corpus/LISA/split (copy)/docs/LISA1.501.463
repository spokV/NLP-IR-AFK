VISUAL COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY' PRIORITIES FOR THE 1980S.
     
SINCE THE LATE 1970S, THE JAPANESE NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE PUBLIC
CORPORATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTING RESEARCH TO DETERMINE WHICH VISUAL
COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND STUDY PROGRAMMES WILL BE REQUIRED IN THE 1980S.
MARKET RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT TO ASCERTAIN THE MAJOR VISUAL COMMUNICATIONS
REQUIREMENTS IN LEADING BUSINESS ORGANISATIONS. THE SYSTEMS FOUND TO HAVE THE
GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT WERE VIDEOCONFERENCING, INTERACTIVE
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, FACSIMILE, DOCUMENT PROCESSING, AND OFFICE AUTOMATION
(THE LATTER INTEGRATING ALL 4 SYSTEMS). IN THE LIGHT OF THESE RESULTS,
SUGGESTS A STUDY PROGRAMME FOR THE 80S AND INDICATES WHICH TECHNOLOGIES SHOULD
BE DEVELOPED.
