PUBLIC LIBRARIES, WHICH WERE PUBLISHED RECENTLY IN THE NETHERLANDS BY THE
NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND
LITERATURE), HAS AROUSED MUCH OPPOSITION FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THE REPORT
WAS SUBMITTED BY THE NBLC TO THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONLY 20%
OF PUBLIC LIBRARY FINANCE. THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE REMAINING 80%, WILL BE REQUIRED TO RAISE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY FROM LOCAL
TAXATION TO MEET THE RECOMMENDED STANDARDS.
