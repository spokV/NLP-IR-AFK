MAINTAIN AND DEVELOP THE UNITY OF THE DANISH LIBRARY SYSTEM!.

INTERVIEWS THE NEW NATIONAL LIBRARIAN, TORKIL OLSEN. HE COMMENTS ON SOME OF
THE PROBLEMS OF THE ROYAL LIBRARY' LACK OF SPACE, THE REVIEW OF SECURITY AFTER
SERIOUS THEFTS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ROYAL LIBRARY AND THE OTHER 2
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN COPENHAGEN. FEARS THAT A COMMON COURSE IN
LIBRARIANSHIP WILL NOT BE SPECIALISED ENOUGH FOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES. SUPPORTS
A JOINT DIRECTORATE FOR THE RESEARCH AND PUBLIC LIBRARY SECTORS UNDER THE
MINISTRY OF CULTURE, BUT BELIEVES IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE LIBRARIES AND THEIR
MOTHER INSTITUTIONS UNDER DIFFERENT MINISTRIES, AND WARNS AGAINST
BUREAUCRATISATION IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ADMINISTRATIVE UNIFICATION. SUPPORTS THE
PRINCIPLE OF NO-CHARGE FOR COMPUTER BASED DOCUMENTATION SERVICES. HOPES THAT
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE RESEARCH LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION WILL BE POSSIBLE AGAIN. THE NEW LIBRARY ACT, WHICH WILL ALSO
ENCOMPASS RESEARCH LIBRARIES, SHOULD HELP IM PROVE THEIR PUBLIC IMAGE.
