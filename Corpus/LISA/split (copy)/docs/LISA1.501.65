THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL INFORMATION IN SMALLER HOSPITALS IN THE NETHERLANDS.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS THE PROVISION OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN HOSPITALS WITH LESS
THAN 100 BEDS IS SERIOUSLY INADEQUATE. A SURVEY OF SMALLER HOSPITALS IN THE US
IN 1975 SHOWED THAT 1/3 OF HOSPITALS SURVEYED HAD SOME FORM OF LIBRARY. THE
PROVISION OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN DUTCH HOSPITALS IS HINDERED BY INADEQUATE
BOOKFUNDS, STAFF AND ACCOMMODATION. FURTHERMORE, IN THE SMALLER HOSPITALS
DOCTORS ARE TOO BUSY WITH ROUTINE WORK TO USE LIBRARY SERVICES. SMALLER
HOSPITALS COULD PROVIDE MEDICAL 'CORE' LIBRARIES OF BASIC TEXTBOOKS AND
PERIODICALS AT MINIMAL COST. SUCH A MEDICAL CORE LIBRARY WAS FORMED IN 1973 AT
THE PRINCESS IRENE HOSPITAL IN ALMELO AND BY 1979 THE LIBRARY CONTAINED 266
BOOKS AND 6 PERIODICAL TITLES.
