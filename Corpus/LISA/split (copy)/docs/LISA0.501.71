TO HAVE A SECTION FOR THE VISUALLY HANDICAPPED WHEN ITS NEW BUILDING IS READY
IN 1983, BUT SOME LARGE PRINT BOOKS ARE AVAILABLE ALREADY. MALAYSIA HAS 4
SOCIETIES FOR THE BLIND. THE MALAYAN ASSOCIATION IN KAULA LUMPUR PRODUCES AND
LENDS BRAILLE BOOKS TO REGISTERED USERS. TALKING BOOKS ARE PRODUCED BY ST.
NICHOLAS SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND IN PENANG. MOST MATERIAL IS IN ENGLISH, BUT IT
IS HOPED TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF BOOKS IN MALAY AT THE EXPENSE OF
ENGLISH, AS THE LATTER MATERIAL CAN BE BORROWED FROM ABROAD.
