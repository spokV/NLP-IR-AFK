COLLECTION PROCESSING AS A TEAM EFFORT.
     
DESCRIBES THE EXPERIMENT, CARRIED OUT AT THE ARCHIVES OF APPALACHIA, TO
COMPARE THE TEAM APPROACH TO COLLECTION PROCESSING WITH THE MORE TRADITIONAL
ONE. STUDENT-WORKERS WERE EMPLOYED ON REPETITIVE PROCESSING TASKS, INCLUDING
CLEANING/FLATTENING AND TREATMENT FOR MOULDS AND INSECT INFESTATION AND
RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL COLLECTIONS WERE PROCESSED EXPEDITIOUSLY
WITHOUT ANY SACRIFICE IN THE QUALITY OF EITHER ARRANGEMENT OR DESCRIPTION AND
TOTAL MONTHLY OUTPUT FROM THE TEAM WAS 3 TIMES THAT FROM A SINGLE ARCHIVIST
WORKING ALONE.
