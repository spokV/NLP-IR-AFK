PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES IN A PRIMARY SCHOOL LIBRARY.
     
HINTER BURG PRIMARY SCHOOL HAS A LIBRARY WITH 5,000 BOOKS AND ALSO RECORDS,
SLIDES, CASSETTES AND EDUCATIONAL FILMS. THERE IS NO QUALIFIED LIBRARIAN, BUT
THE TEACHERS RUN THE LIBRARY WITH REASONABLE SUCCESS. MORE MONEY IS NEEDED FOR
STOCKS, FOR EXPANSION AND BECAUSE BOOKS WEAR OUT QUICKLY. THE CHILDREN ARE TOO
YOUNG TO STUDY INDEPENDENTLY THERE BUT THEY ARE ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED TO USE
BOOKS. ALL CLASSES EXCEPT THE LOWEST HAVE REGULAR WEEKLY INSTRUCTION IN THE
LIBRARY. THERE IS ACTIVE COOPERATION WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY; THE
LIBRARIAN ADVISES ON PURCHASES AND ARRANGES MUSIC AND STORY-TELLING SESSIONS
FOR THE CHILDREN. GOOD CONTACTS WITH PARENTS AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITY HAVE ALSO
PROVED HELPFUL.
