LIBRARY.

LIBRARIES CONSISTING OF A CENTRAL LIBRARY AND BRANCHES IN UNIVERSITY
DEPARTMENTS, NEW PROBLEMS HAVE ARISEN IN THE LAST 10 YEARS CONCERNING THE
ORGANISATION, DIRECTION AND PLANNING OF LIBRARY PROCEDURE CORRESPONDING TO THE
EXTENDED FUNCTIONS AND DIMENSIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. THE INSTITUTE OF
LIBRARY SCIENCE SHOULD ENSURE THAT GRADUATE LIBRARIANS RECEIVE APPROPRIATE
TRAINING TO ALLOW THEM TO COPE WITH THE WORK DEMANDED OF THEM AT UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES. THIS WILL INCLUDE' ALL TYPES OF BOOK PROCESSING; WORK WITH USERS;
PUBLICISING LIBRARY STOCK, ESPECIALLY CULTURAL HERITAGE COLLECTIONS; ACTIVITY
IN HALLS OF RESIDENCE LIBRARIES; COORDINATING WORK BETWEEN DIFFERENT SECTIONS
OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY; LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY; STORAGE AND MAINTENANCE.
LIBRARY GRADUATES SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING THE THEORETICAL CONTENT
OF PRACTICA L PROBLEMS AND FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THEM WHICH CAN BE CARRIED OUT
IN PRACTICE.
