NORMS AND FUNCTIONS IN CITATION' THE VIEW OF JOURNAL EDITORS AND REFEREES IN
PSYCHOLOGY.

THE VIEWS OF PSYCHOLOGY JOURNAL EDITORS AND EDITORIAL ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERS
WERE SOUGHT ON THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF CITATION. INFORMATION WAS GATHERED
USING AN 18 ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE. THE FEELING EMERGED THAT CITATION WAS A SKILL
WHICH AUTHORS ACQUIRED OSMOTICALLY. CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT WAS GIVEN TO THE IDEA
THAT EDITORS AND REFEREES COULD PLAY A MORE POSITIVE ROLE IN ESTABLISHING AND
ENCOURAGING CONSISTENCY IN AUTHORS' CITATION PRACTICES. WHERE APPROPRIATE,
REPLIES HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF PREVAILING THEORY. PRACTICAL
REASONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS AREA ARE ALSO CONSIDERED.
