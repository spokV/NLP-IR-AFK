UTAH.

A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BY THE MONOGRAPHS ORDER DIVISION, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH
LIBRARIES, TO COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF 3 DOMESTIC BOOK VENDORS DURING FISCAL
YEAR 1978-79. THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF SPEED,
DISCOUNT AND SERVICE, AND TO COMPARE VENDOR SUCCESS IN FILLING ORDERS FOR
EASILY OBTAINABLE TRADE MATERIALS VERSUS MORE SCHOLARLY MATERIALS. RESULTS
SHOWED CONSIDERABLE VARIATION AMONG VENDORS WITH RESPECT TO SPEED, DISCOUNT
AND ABILITY TO FILL THE MORE OBSCURE ORDERS.
