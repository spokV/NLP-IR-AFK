LIBRARY'S PROBLEMS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION. THE
LIBRARIAN PREPARED A REPORT AS AN INTRODUCTION TO AN ORAL PRESENTATION BY THE
COMMITTEE TO THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT. PRESENTS THE TEXT OF THE REPORT, WHICH
STRESSES THE VITAL CENTRAL ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN A STRONG UNIVERSITY.
