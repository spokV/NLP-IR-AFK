THE OFFICIAL 1977-UNESCO STATISTICS SHOW THAT, AS FAR AS NUMBERS OF LIBRARIES
AND LIBRARIANS, AND ALSO ANNUAL ACQUISITIONS PER HEAD OF POPULATION, ARE
CONCERNED, BULGARIA LIES IN THE 7TH AND 4TH PLACES RESPECTIVELY IN THE WORLD.
HOWEVER, BULGARIA TAKES THE 14TH AND 19TH PLACES IN LOANS AND IN TURNOVER OF
CURRENT BOOK COLLECTIONS. THUS, HIGHER EFFICIENCY REQUIRED IN ALL FIELDS OF
THE NATION'S LIFE BY THE RECENT 12TH CONGRESS OF THE BULGARIAN COMMUNIST PARTY
MUST ALSO BE AIMED FOR IN LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES. GREAT ATTENTION
MUST BE PAID IN PARTICULAR TO SCIENTIFIC AND OTHER SPECIAL LIBRARIES WHICH
NEED TO COPE NOT ONLY WITH THE PRESENT INFORMATION EXPLOSION, BUT ALSO WITH
SOARING PRICES OF WESTERN PUBLICATIONS AND BULGARIA'S LIMITED FOREIGN CURRENCY
RESOURCES. AMONGST OTHER PROBLEMS ARE THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF
LIBRARIANS, THE NEEDS IN NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS, MECHANISATION, AUTOMATION, AND
UPDATING OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT. THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY, NOT
ONLY AS KEEPER OF THE NATIONAL LITERARY HERITAGE, BUT ALSO AS THE MOST
IMPORTANT LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTRE IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY, IS, IN ITSELF,
A SPECIAL CASE. IT SHOULD BE RELIEVED OF SOME OF ITS PROBLEMS ON THE OCCASION
OF THE 1300TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BULGARIAN STATE.
