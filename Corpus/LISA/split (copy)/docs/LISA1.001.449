FACSIMILE TRANSMITS TYPED/SIGNED MESSAGES AT LOW-COST.

BOTH ANALOG AND DIGITAL FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION HAVE ADVANTAGES, DEPENDING ON
USER NEEDS. BOTH HAVE ELECTRONIC MAIL CAPABILITIES AND CAN BE USED IN
CONJUNCTION WITH A 'VALUE-ADDED NETWORK' TO COMMUNICATE WITH
OTHERWISE-INCOMPATIBLE EQUIPMENT. CRITERIA TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN SELECTING
FACSIMILE EQUIPMENT ARE MAXIMUM DOCUMENT SIZE ACCEPTED; OPERATING SPEED; COPY
QUALITY; PURCHASE, RENTAL, AND RUNNING COSTS; AND EQUIPMENT SIZE.
