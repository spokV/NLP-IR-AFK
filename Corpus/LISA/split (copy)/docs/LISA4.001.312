REQUIREMENTS FOR ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL INFORMATION NUCLEUS IN NORTH EAST
BRAZIL.
     
TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROBLEMS OF ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL INFORMATION NETWORK,
THE EXISTING INFORMATION RESOURCES IN BRAZIL'S NORTHEAST WERE INVESTIGATED.
DATA OBTAINED FROM THE 2BRAZILIAN STATISTICAL ANNUAL1 AND THE BRAZILIAN
2NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE OF PERIODICALS1 SHOWED THAT COMPARED TO OTHER
REGIONS, ALTHOUGH RELATIVELY WELL ENDOWED WITH LIBRARIES, THE NORTHEAST IS
INADEQUATELY SUPPLIED WITH PERIODICALS, AND THAT THE MAJORITY OF COLLECTIONS
ARE INCOMPLETE OR DUPLICATED. A PLANNED ACQUISITION PROGRAMME FOR SERIALS,
BACKED BY AN ORGANISED INTERLIBRARY LOAN POLICY, IS RECOMMENDED, TOGETHER WITH
INVESTIGATIONS TO ESTABLISH USER NEEDS AND PERIODICAL USAGE, AS ESSENTIAL
PRELIMINARIES FOR NETWORK PLANNING.
