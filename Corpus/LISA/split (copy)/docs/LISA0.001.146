THE PLANNING PROCESS-IS IT FOR ME?.N

OTES THE CONCERN GENERATED AMONGST SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED US PUBLIC LIBRARIES
BY THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S A PLANNING PROCESS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES,
AND DISCUSSES THE IMPORTANCE OF PLANNING. ADVISES LIBRARIANS ON HOW TO DEVELOP
A CONFIDENT PLANNING ATTITUDE, AND HOW TO ESTABLISH GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND
REALISE THEIR INTERRELATIONSHIPS. AIMS NOT AT CREATING ANOTHER PLANNING
PROCESS, BUT AT ENCOURAGING AMONGST LIBRARIANS THE SELF CONFIDENCE TO DIGEST
WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN, AND TO CHOOSE THAT WHICH BEST SUITS THEIR INDIVIDUAL
SITUATION.
