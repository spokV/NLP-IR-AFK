INTELLIGENT ACCESS TO PRESTEL.
     
THE FACILITIES OF PRESTEL, THE UK POST OFFICE VIEWDATA SERVICE, ARE OUTLINED,
EMPHASISING THE ASPECTS OF ITS DESIGN WHICH MAKE IT VERY EASY TO USE. THE VERY
SIMPLE STRUCTURE OF THE DATA IS ALSO DISCUSSED AND COMPARED WITH OTHER
VIEWDATA SYSTEMS. NORMAL PRESTEL TERMINALS HAVE LIMITED CAPABILITIES BUT
INTELLIGENT TERMINALS ARE BEING DEVELOPED WHICH WILL ALLOW TELESOFTWARE TO BE
USED FOR PROGRAM DISTRIBUTION. AN EXAMPLE OF THE USE OF SUCH PROGRAMS IS TO
IMPROVE THE METHOD OF ACCESS TO SPECIFIC DATA. SOME EXAMPLES ARE DESCRIBED
WITH EMPHASIS ON THE NEED TO RETAIN THE UNDERLYING SIMPLICITY WHEN ADDING NEW
CAPABILITIES.
