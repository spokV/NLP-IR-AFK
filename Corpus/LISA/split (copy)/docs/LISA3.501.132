LIBRARIES AND EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTING.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTING AND LIBRARIES.
DESCRIBES THE LINKS BETWEEN RENFREW DISTRICT LIBRARIES AND THE BBC ADULT
LITERACY PROJECT. IN 1975, THE SCOTTISH ADULT LITERACY AGENCY AWARDED THE
MATERIALS WERE USED TO EXTEND THE LIBRARY'S SERVICES. THE BBC SHOWED GREAT
ENTHUSIASM FOR THE PROJECT AND SELECTED PAISLEY AS A VENUE FOR THE ROADSHOW
PROGRAMME-A SUCCESSFUL VENTURE, ALTHOUGH IT OVERSIMPLIFIED THE SERVICES AND
INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE LIBRARIES. LIBRARIES MUST RESPOND TO THE INTEREST
GENERATED BY THE MEDIA, BY PROVIDING RESOURCES, STUDY FACILITIES, AND
PROFESSIONAL SKILLS REQUIRED OF LIBRARIANS BY INDIVIDUALS IN AN OPEN LEARNING
SITUATION.
