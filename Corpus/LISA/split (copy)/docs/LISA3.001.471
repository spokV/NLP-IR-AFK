DISPLAY TECHNOLOGIES FOR OFFICE SYSTEMS.
     
CONSIDERS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR AN IDEAL OFFICE DISPLAY AND COMPARES CRT
(CATHODE RAY TUBES) WITH MATRIX DISPLAYS TO SEE HOW CLOSELY THEY CAN MEET
REQUIREMENTS. THE CRT CAN MEET THE DISPLAY FUNCTION REQUIREMENTS BUT IS NOT
IDEAL IN SPACE TAKEN, POWER AND WEIGHT. NO OTHER DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY CAN MEET
THE RANGE OF FUNCTION REQUIRED BUT THEY HAVE ATTRACTIONS IN SIZE AND SHAPE AND
AS TECHNOLOGIES IMPROVE MAY MEET THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
