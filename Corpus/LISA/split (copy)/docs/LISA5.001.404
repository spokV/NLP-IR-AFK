VISUAL LITERACY' A VITAL SKILL.

THE ABILITY TO DRAW APPROPRIATE MEANING FROM A VISUAL REPRESENTATION (OF
WHATEVER KIND) IS AN IMPORTANT INFORMATION SKILL. STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO
INTERROGATE MAPS, DIAGRAMS, PAINTINGS, PHOTOGRAPHS AND OTHER VISUAL IMAGES,
INCLUDING MOVING PICTURES, RECOGNISING SPECIFIC CONVENTIONS IN USE AND THEIR
LIMITATIONS. CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF CONTENT AND CONTEXT, THE IMPLICATIONS OF
SUPPORTING TEXTUAL OR AURAL ACCOMPANIMENT, AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE
POSSIBILITIES OF MANIPULATION AND BIAS, NEED TO BE CAREFULLY NURTURED. THE
VALUE OF PICTORIAL SOURCES FOR PRIMARY RESEARCH DATA IS EMPHASISED.
