THE NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY IN KIEL-A LUCKY CHANCE.
     
A CONVENIENT CENTRAL SITE WAS FOUND FOR THE NEW LIBRARY AT KIEL, WHOSE STOCKS
TOTAL 100,000 ITEMS. THE BUILDING WAS DESIGNED FOR FLEXIBILITY; COVERING A
TOTAL AREA OF 4,600 SQ.M., IT SETS A STANDARD FOR TOWNS OF THIS SIZE. THE
GROUND FLOOR AREA, FOR ISSUE COUNTER, CLOAKROOM AND NEWSPAPERS, IS RATHER
SMALL BUT THE UPPER STOREYS ARE GENEROUSLY PROPORTIONED. THE 1ST FLOOR HOUSES
THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY, FICTION AND A MEETING-ROOM SEATING 100 PEOPLE; A SMALL
AUDIO CENTRE IS PLANNED HERE BUT ULTIMATELY KIEL WILL PROBABLY HAVE A SEPARATE
MUSIC LIBRARY AND AUDIO CENTRE ELSEWHERE. THE 2ND FLOOR CONTAINS NON-FICTION,
PERIODICALS, NEWSPAPER CUTTINGS, PAMPHLETS, CATALOGUES AND INFORMATION
SERVICES. ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS ARE ON THE 3RD AND 4TH FLOORS AND THERE
IS ALSO A SMALL CELLAR STACK.
