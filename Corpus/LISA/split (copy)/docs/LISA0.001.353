THE USE OF PRINTED CARDS OF THE ALL-UNION BOOK CHAMBER IN AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY.

4 YEARS AGO THE REGIONAL LIBRARY OF THE VORONEZH STATE UNIVERSITY INTRODUCED A
NEW METHOD OF USING THE PRINTED CARDS OF THE ALL-UNION BOOK CHAMBER. IN THE
PAST, THE LIBRARY STAFF HAD TO FILL IN 7 FULL SETS OF THE CARDS, DESPITE THE
FACT THAT ONLY 20-30% OF THE CARDS WERE ACTUALLY USED IN CATALOGUES. INSTEAD
OF FULL SETS THE LIBRARY NOW USES SERIAL SETS. DEPENDING ON THE SUBJECT OF THE
CATALOGUED DOCUMENT (FOR EXAMPLE LITERATURE ON HUMANITIES IS INCLUDED IN 3
CATALOGUES), 1-8 COPIES OF THE SERIAL SET CARDS ARE FILLED IN. THEIR USE
RESULTED IN A CONSIDERABLE FINANCIAL SAVING AND IN REDUCED LABOUR CONSUMPTION.
THE PROCESSING OF THE PRINTED CARDS IS DESCRIBED.
