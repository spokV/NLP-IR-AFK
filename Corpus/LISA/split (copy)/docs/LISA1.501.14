LIBRARY RESEARCH-SCRUTINY OF AN INVESTIGATION.
     
COMMENTS ON THE REPORT BY THE LIBRARY SCHOOL'S WORKING PARTY ON A PROGRAMME
FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH. APPROVES THE PROGRAMME'S STRESS ON RESEARCH
QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE LIBRARY SCHOOL STAFF. THE PROGRAMME IS THE 1ST ATTEMPT
AT A SURVEY AND ANALYSIS OF LIBRARY RESEARCH IN SWEDEN AND RIGHTLY STRESSES
THE NEED FOR DATA ON THE DIFFERENT ATTITUDES TO AND USE OF LIBRARIES BY THE
ARTS AND THE SCIENCES. BUT IT NEGLECTS AN OBVIOUS RESEARCH AREA-COOPERATION
BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY FOR EFFICIENT USE OF SCARCE RESOURCES. IN A
TIME OF ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH WHICH
MAY PROVIDE ARGUMENTS VIS-A-VIS THE GRANT GIVING AUTHORITIES FOR
'NON-QUANTIFIABLE INCOME' OR SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS. THE EMPHASIS IN THE
PROGRAMME WILL AT 1ST RIGHTLY BE ON USER STUDIES AND STUDIES AIMED AT
IMPROVING SERVICES.
