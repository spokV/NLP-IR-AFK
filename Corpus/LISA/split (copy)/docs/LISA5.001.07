PERCEPTIONS BY EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTRATORS OF THE RANKING OF LIBRARY SCHOOL
PROGRAMS.

A STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO DETERMINE PROFESSIONAL PERCEPTION OF HIGHEST-QUALITY
LIBRARY EDUCATION PROGRAMMES. THE SURVEY SOUGHT TO DETERMINE PERCEPTION
RANKINGS OF EXCELLENCE IN 4 CATEGORIES' QUALITY OF MASTER'S PROGRAMME, QUALITY
OF DOCTORAL PROGRAMME FOR THE PREPARATION OF EDUCATORS, QUALITY OF DOCTORAL
PROGRAMME FOR THE PREPARATION OF ADMINISTRATORS, AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE
PROFESSION BY THE FACULTY AS A WHOLE. RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF
EARLIER, SMALLER SAMPLE STUDIES, AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH TO
EXAMINE THE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF SCHOOLS GENERALLY PERCEIVED AS BEING OF
HIGH QUALITY ARE ADVANCED. SUGGESTS THAT AN EXAMINATION OF THESE QUALITIES IN
HIGHLY PERCEIVED SCHOOLS CAN LEAD TO A MEANINGFUL UPGRADING OF PRESENT
EVALUATIVE STANDARDS.
