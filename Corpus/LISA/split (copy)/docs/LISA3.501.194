THE USE OF AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES' IDEAS FOR A NEW VIEWPOINT.
     
ALTHOUGH LIBRARIANS FORMERLY ADOPTED A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE WHEN INTRODUCING
AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING, ITS USE RESULTED IN ERGONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS AND MORE
INTERESTING WORK FOR SOME STAFF. THE USE OF AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING CAN,
HOWEVER, CAUSE STRESS AND MONOTONY, THE CONTROL OF WORK AND HUMAN POTENTIAL BY
MACHINES, INCREASED ISOLATION OF INDIVIDUALS, THE DOWNGRADING OF SOME LIBRARY
POSTS AND THE LOSS OF A FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE FOR READERS. IF THE HUMAN TOUCH IS
TO BE RETAINED IN LIBRARIES, NEW STANDARDS ARE REQUIRED. GOOD COMMUNICATION
MUST BE DEVELOPED BETWEEN STAFF MEMBERS AND BETWEEN STAFF AND READERS. STAFF
WORK MUST BE REORGANISED AND THE TENDENCY TO GIGANTISM IN THE USE OF
AUTOMATION AVOIDED.
