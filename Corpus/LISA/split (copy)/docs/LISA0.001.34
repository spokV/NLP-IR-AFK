BY ONE WHO HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN PART OF ITS DEVELOPMENT, AND NOTES THE INFLUENCE
OF FOREIGN LIBRARY TRADITIONS. CONCLUDES THAT IN LIBRARY EDUCATION, AS IN MANY
OTHER RESPECTS, ISRAEL IS A LABORATORY WHERE THE INTERPLAY OF DIFFERENT (AND
OFTEN CONTRADICTORY) SOCIAL FORCES AND DIVERSE CULTURAL TRADITIONS CAN BE
OBSERVED AND, TO SOME EXTENT, TESTED.
