LOMBARDY' THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SYSTEM FOR COLLECTIVE CATALOGUING AND
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION.
     
DISCUSSES THE REASONS BEHIND THE SUSPENSION OF THE PROJECTED NETWORK IN
LOMBARDY, BEGUN IN 1975 AND DISRUPTED IN 1977. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE
STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM DRAWN UP BY THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION, THE
ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF EXISTING LIBRARIES AS INFORMATION AND
CATALOGUING CENTRES, AND THE TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT INTRODUCED. WITH THE CHANGE
OF GOVERNMENT IN 1977, THE PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED FOR RE-EVALUATION, AND UP TO
1980 NO DECISION HAD BEEN REACHED. THE INHERENT DEFECTS OF THE SYSTEM ARE
ANALYSED, TO SHOW HOW THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION MADE A FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN
ESTABLISHING A DECENTRALISED SYSTEM WITHOUT OVERHAULING EXISTING SERVICES TO
ENSURE ADEQUATE COOPERATION BETWEEN CATALOGUING CENTRES. THE IMMEDIATE CAUSES
OF SUSPENSION WERE INCOMPATABILITY OF THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM CHOSEN WITH MARC,
AND FAILURE OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES TO MAINTAIN ROUTINE CATALOGUING
ACTIVITIES. EMPH ASISES THE NECESSITY FOR BASIC REORGANISATION OF NATIONAL
LIBRARY SERVICES PRIOR TO SCHEMES FOR AUTOMATION AND COOPERATION.
