READ TO THEM.

FEW PARENTS REGULARLY READ STORIES ALOUD TO THEIR CHILDREN. THE AFFECTIONATE
ATMOSPHERE GIVEN BY READING A STORY IS REASSURING AND SECURITY-BUILDING AT ANY
AGE. IT IS A MISTAKE TO DISCONTINUE THE PRACTICE. THE CHILD LEARNS LANGUAGE,
AND ABOUT THE WRITTEN WORD THROUGH THIS. READING TO HIM CAN HELP HIM TO
UNDERSTAND CONCEPTS HE CANNOT GRASP BY READING TO HIMSELF. LITERATURE WITH
HUMOUR, INSIGHT AND MATURITY NEEDS TO BE SOUGHT. CHILDREN FROM LITERARY RATHER
THAN GIFTED BACKGROUNDS ARE THE BEST READERS.
