PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' A NEW LAW IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

REVIEWS BRIEFLY THE MAIN ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD BY THE UK LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
AGAINST THE 1979 PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT ACT, WHICH ESTABLISHED THE RIGHT OF
AUTHORS TO SOME FINANCIAL REWARD BASED ON THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THEIR BOOKS
ARE BORROWED FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. SUMMARISES THE MAIN PROVISIONS OF THE ACT,
WHICH REQUIRES THE COMPILATION OF A REGISTER OF BOOKS AND AUTHORS ENTITLED TO
PAYMENT. DISCUSSES THE CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENT ON THIS SCHEME WHICH WAS
PUBLISHED IN 1980, AND INDICATES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WHICH ARE LIKELY TO
ARISE WHEN IT COMES INTO OPERATION. NOTES THAT THE ACT APPARENTLY DOES NOT
APPLY TO MUSIC-WHICH IS PRESUMABLY DEEMED TO BE COVERED BY PERFORMING RIGHTS.
