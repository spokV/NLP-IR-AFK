RAK (RULES FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING) DISCUSSED.

THE AUTHORISED EDITION OF RAK WAS PUBLISHED IN BERLIN IN 1976 AND IN WIESBADEN
IN 1977. THIS COMPLETED ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING REFORM IN GERMANY. FROM
1976-79 MUCH LITERATURE DEALING WITH RAK WAS PUBLISHED. MANY OF THE
PUBLICATIONS WERE CONCERNED WITH ADAPTATIONS OF RAK TO SPECIFIC TYPES OF
LIBRARIES SUCH AS RAK-WB (WISSENSCHAFTLICHE BIBLIOTHEKEN) ACADEMIC LIBRARIES
OR RAK-OB (OFFENTLICHE BIBLIOTHEKEN) PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THIS WAS ALSO THE CASE
IN EAST GERMANY WHERE ADAPTATIONS OF RAK FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES, RESEARCH
LIBRARIES AND UNION LIBRARIES WERE PUBLISHED. LITERATURE IS AVAILABLE
EXPLAINING IN DETAIL THE USE OF RAK IN CERTAIN SUBJECT AREAS SUCH AS LAW,
BIBLICAL LITERATURE, ARCHIVE LITERATURE, JOURNALS, NEWSPAPERS AND CONGRESS
REPORTS. REPORTS AND DISCUSSIONS ON EXPERIENCES OF LIBRARIES IN THE
INTRODUCTION OF RAK AND THE BEST METHODS OF TRAINING STAFF MOSTLY STEM FROM
EAST GERMANY AND ARE ONLY FIRST INITIATIVES IN THIS FIELD.
