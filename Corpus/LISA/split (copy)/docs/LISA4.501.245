THE LIBRARY AS A MUNICIPAL INFORMATION CENTRE' A DANISH EXAMPLE.
     
WITH THE EVER-INCREASING AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION AT NATIONAL AND
LOCAL LEVEL IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ALL CITIZENS HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT
THEIR RIGHTS AND DUTIES. AT LYNGBY-TAARBAEK IN DENMARK A DEPARTMENT OF
COMMUNITY INFORMATION WAS CREATED IN 1977 TO PROVIDE SUCH A SERVICE. THE
COLLECTION INCLUDES MATERIAL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING, MINUTES OF LOCAL
COUNCIL MEETINGS, AND THE ADDRESSES AND SERVICES OF LOCAL ORGANISATIONS.
EXHIBITIONS ARE HELD ON TOPICS OF CURRENT INTEREST AND A LARGE PART OF THE
COLLECTION IS AVAILABLE FOR LOAN. AT THE START OF THE SERVICE A PUBLICITY
CAMPAIGN WAS HELD WITH ADVERTISING POSTERS AND NOTICES IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS,
AND THE DEPARTMENT NOW ANSWERS SOME 300-400 ENQUIRIES PER MONTH.
