DISCUSSES BIBLIOMETRY AND ITS USES, IN CONNECTION WITH A COURSE HELD IN
FINLAND, IN OCT 81. BIBLIOMETRY IS A MATHEMATICAL AID FOR ANALYSING LIBRARY
PROBLEMS. UNLIKE TRADITIONAL LIBRARY STATISTICS, WHICH USE GROUPS, BIBLIOMETRY
RANKS INDIVIDUAL UNITS. IT IS A METHOD BASED ON SIMPLE LOGARITHMIC RELATIONS
AND IS USED TO DESCRIBE GROWTH, OBSOLESCENCE AND SPREAD. ITS USEFULNESS IS
ESPECIALLY APPARENT IN A TIME OF CUTS. GIVES AN EXAMPLE WHICH SHOWS THAT
BIBLIOMETRIC SCALES OF THE USE OF PERIODICALS CAN BE USED TO FACILITATE CUTS,
AND ANOTHER IN WHICH BIBLIOMETRY HAS BEEN USED TO ANALYSE THE ATTRACTION
EXERCISED BY A FEW PERIODICALS AND THEIR EFFECT ON PUBLICATION OF ARTICLES.
