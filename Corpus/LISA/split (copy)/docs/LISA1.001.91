A CRITICAL COMMENTARY ON LEIMKUHLER'S 'EXACT' FORMULATION OF THE BRADFORD LAW.

ARGUES THAT POWERFUL OPERATIONAL RESEARCH TECHNIQUES OPERATE ONLY ON A SMALL
FRACTION OF THE STATISTICAL INFORMATION USUALLY PROVIDED BY THE SOCIAL
SCIENCES. USES THE ARGUMENT TO ILLUSTRATE LEIMKUHLER'S RECENT CLAIM TO HAVE
FOUND AN 'EXACT' FIT TO BRADFORD'S LAW. AN ELEMENTARY THEOREM OF SHANNON
INFORMATION THEORY SHOWS THAT HIS NEW FUNCTION IS APPLIED TO ONLY 2.3% OF THE
STATISTICAL INFORMATION INHERENT IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHY HE CHOOSES AND THAT
BRADFORD'S ORIGINAL SIMPLE FORMULATION NOT ONLY FITS THIS SEGMENT BUT ALSO THE
WHOLE BIBLIOGRAPHY MORE CLOSELY THAN THE NEW FORMULATION. AS EVERY STATISTICAL
INFORMATION LOSS CAN BE MEASURED, IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT SOPHISTICATED
MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES CANNOT COMPENSATE FOR THE INFORMATION THEY SQUANDER.
