CASSETTES-A MEANINGFUL COMPLEMENT TO THE BOOK.
     
IF LIBRARIES STOCK CASSETTES, NEW READERS ARE ATTRACTED TO THE LIBRARY AND
LOAN FIGURES RISE. CASSETTES SHOULD BE PLACED WITH OR NEAR BOOKS ON THE SAME
SUBJECT; THEY SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED IN THE SAME WAY AS BOOKS AND ENTERED IN THE
MAIN CATALOGUE. MUSIC CASSETTES ARE AN EXCELLENT COMPLEMENT TO MUSIC
LITERATURE AND CAN STIMULATE PEOPLE TO READ BOOKS ABOUT MUSIC. CASSETTES FOR
CHILDREN MAY ENCOURAGE CHILDREN TO READ WHO ARE NOT YET KEEN READERS; GOOD
QUALITY CASSETTES MUST BE SELECTED SINCE THERE IS A WIDE RANGE ON THE MARKET
IN THIS FIELD. LANGUAGE CASSETTES SHOULD BE ARRANGED ON BOOKSHELVES WITH THEIR
ACCOMPANYING TEXTBOOKS. LITERATURE CASSETTES ARE USEFUL FOR READERS WITH POOR
SIGHT, SO THEY SHOULD BE PLACED NEAR THE LARGE PRINT BOOKS; THEY ARE ALSO
HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE WITH READING DIFFICULTIES AND FOR GROUP LISTENING AND
DISCUSSION.
