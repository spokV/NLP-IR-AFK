BILL TO AMEND IRS CODE REGARDING CONFIDENTIALITY OF TAX INFORMATION.

THE US BILL IS INTENDED TO STREAMLINE AND CLARIFY PROVISIONS OF THE INTERNAL
REVENUE SERVICE CODE GOVERNING ACCESS TO TAX INFORMATION FOR USE IN NON-TAX
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS. THE BILL WOULD CLARIFY AMBIGUITIES
IN EXISTING LAWS, REFINE NEEDLESSLY CUMBERSOME PROCEDURES, AND DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN PRIVACY RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS AS CONTRASTED WITH THOSE OF LEGAL
ENTITIES SUCH AS CORPORATIONS.
