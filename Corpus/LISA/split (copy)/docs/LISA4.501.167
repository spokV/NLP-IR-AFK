EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.

REPORT: PROJECT LIBRARY AND EDUCATION IN BALLERUP. 6 PARTS DEAL WITH SENIOR
SECONDARY SCHOOLS, PREPARATORY COURSES, COMMERCIAL COLLEGES, TEACHER TRAINING
COLLEGES, NURSERY SCHOOL TRAINING, AND TECHNICAL COLLEGES. PUBLIC LIBRARIES
CARRY OUT LIBRARY SERVICES FOR MOST OF THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND IT IS
TIME THAT THEY BEGAN TO CLARIFY THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN SERVICE TO STUDENTS.
NO INSTITUTION HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR LIBRARY SERVICES TO INTERMEDIATE
EDUCATION, AND INTERESTED TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS ARE DISCOURAGED BY THE
AUTHORITIES. TASKS SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY AND
THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION, THE PUBLIC LIBRARY DEALING WITH INTERLENDING AND
THE COLLEGE WITH MATERIAL FOR PROJECT ORIENTED TEACHING DEMANDING MULTIPLE
COPIES. DISCUSSES THE KIND OF MATERIAL WHICH SHOULD BE FOUND I N THE SENIOR
SECONDARY SCHOOL. THE COLLEGES CANNOT BE SELF-SUFFICIENT IN LIBRARY MATERIAL
AND USE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE REGIONAL RESOURCE CENTRES WILL ALWAYS BE
NECESSARY. REGISTRATION OF OLD MATERIAL AND WITHDRAWALS SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT
FOR THE COLLEGES BY CENTRAL LIBRARY BODIES.
