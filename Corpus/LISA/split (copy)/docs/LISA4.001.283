AN EVALUATION OF SOME CONFLATION ALGORITHMS FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
     
A CONFLATION ALGORITHM IDENTIFIES WORD VARIANTS AND REDUCES THEM TO A SINGLE
CANONICAL FORM. DISCUSSES ITS CHARACTERISTICS AND GIVES EXAMPLES OF SOME TYPES
WHICH HAVE BEEN USED IN COMPUTERISED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS WITH A RANGE OF KEYWORD DICTIONARIES AND WITH THE
CRANFIELD DOCUMENTATION TEST COLLECTION SUGGEST THAT THERE IS RELATIVELY
LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ALGORITHMS DESPITE THE DISPARATE
MEANS BY WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND BY WHICH THEY OPERATE.
