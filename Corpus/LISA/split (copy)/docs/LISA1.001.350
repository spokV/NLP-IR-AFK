A STRATEGY FOR ARCHIVING GOVERNMENT DATA TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE RESEARCH
COMMUNITY.

THE GOVERNMENT IS THE GREATEST COLLECTOR AND USER OF INFORMATION. STATISTICS
CANADA HAS IDENTIFIED 2,352 MAJOR GOVERNMENT DATA BANKS IN CANADA. IN RESPONSE
TO A GROWING RECOGNITION THAT GOVERNMENT HAS GONE TOO FAR IN ITS DATA
COLLECTION ACTIVITIES, IT IS TRYING TO REDUCE ITS 'PAPERBURDEN'. PERHAPS ONE
SOLUTION IS TO INSTITUTE A RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT STRATEGY FOR ARCHIVING
THESE GOVERNMENT DATA, BUT STILL MEET THE NEEDS OF THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY.
SUGGESTS THAT THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT MUST ESTABLISH THE INFORMATION OVER
WHICH IT HAS OWNERSHIP AND THE CONDITION OF SUCH OWNERSHIP; NO GOVERNMENT
RECORD MAY BE DESTROYED OR ALTERED WITHOUT CONSENT FROM THE DOMINION ARCHIVIST
OR HIS DESIGNATE; AND THE DOMINION ARCHIVIST MUST HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECLARE
ANY GOVERNMENT RECORD OR COPY THEREOF AN ARCHIVAL RECORD.
