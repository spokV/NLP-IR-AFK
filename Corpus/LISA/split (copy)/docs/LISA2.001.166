RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING REGIONAL NETWORK SYSTEMS AND BUILDING UP
REGIONAL LIBRARY CENTRES.
     
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING REGIONAL NETWORK SYSTEMS AND BUILDING UP
REGIONAL LIBRARY CENTRES WERE PUT FORWARD BY THE SUB-COMMITTEE ON DATA
PROCESSING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LIBRARY COMMITTEE OF THE GERMAN RESEARCH
SOCIETY (DEUTCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT). THEY UNDERLINE HOW NECESSARY AND
URGENT IT IS TO BUILD UP REGIONAL DATA PROCESSING NETWORKS FOR COOPERATIVE
CATALOGUING IN LIBRARIES. REGIONAL NETWORKS PROVIDE THE OPTIMAL MEANS OF
RATIONALISING LIBRARY WORK. THESE NETWORKS SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUCTED IN ALL 11
FEDERAL STATES BUT SHOULD BE BUILT UP ON THE EXISTING 7 LENDING SYSTEM
REGIONS; THEY WOULD ALL BE CONNECTED IN A NATIONAL NETWORK. REGIONAL LIBRARY
CENTRES WOULD FORM THE NATIONAL NETWORK AND WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING GENERAL
TASK AREAS' CATALOGUING AND ACQUISITION, CENTRAL EDITING OF CATALOGUES ETC.,
DATA EXCHANGE WITH OTHER CENTRAL INSTITUTES AND NETWORKS, SUPPLYING ORDERED
BOO KS WITHIN THE PLANNED NATIONAL ORDER SYSTEM, DEVELOPING SYSTEMS AND
PROGRAMMES FOR THE SOFTWARE OF THE REGIONAL NETWORK, AND PLANNING AND
COORDINATION.
