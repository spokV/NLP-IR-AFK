THE EXPLOITATION OF AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS IN POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES' A
COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE USE OF AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS.

(MLIB DISSERTATION.) EXAMINES THE EXPLOITATION OF AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS IN
THE LIBRARIES OF 4 POLYTECHNICS-BRIGHTON, NEWCASTLE, PLYMOUTH AND THAMES. 3
MAIN ELEMENTS ARE INVESTIGATED-ADMINISTRATION, AVAILABILITY, AND MEANS OF
EXPLOITATION. BRIGHTON APPROACHES THE IDEAL SITUATION; NEWCASTLE FULLY
INTEGRATES THE MATERIALS, BUT LOCATION OF SOME EQUIPMENT AFFECTS THEIR USE;
PLYMOUTH'S USER EDUCATION PROGRAMME AIDS EXPLOITATION OF THE COLLECTION; AND
THAMES HAS TOO LITTLE SPACE AND AN INADEQUATE COLLECTION, REFLECTING THE LACK
OF A WHOLEHEARTED APPROACH TO AUDIO-VISUAL PROVISION.
