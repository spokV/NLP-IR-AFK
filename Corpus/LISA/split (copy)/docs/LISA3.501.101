THE NEEDS OF THE SPECIAL LIBRARIAN AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.
     
LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIANS BECAUSE
THEY USUALLY WORK ALONE OR WITH VERY FEW COLLEAGUES AND NEED ASSOCIATIONS TO
STAY IN TOUCH WITH OTHER LIBRARIANS AND WITH CHANGES IN LIBRARIANSHIP. THE
NEEDS FOR CONTACT WITH COLLEAGUES, FOR UP-TO-DATE KNOWLEDGE, AND SKILLS, FOR
COOPERATION THROUGH INTERLIBRARY LOANS AND NETWORKS, AND THROUGH PROVISION OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIC TOOLS, FOR INFLUENCING LEGISLATION, FOR FORMULATING AND
PROMOTING STANDARDS, AND FOR PERSONAL STATUS AND ACHIEVEMENT ARE DISCUSSED.
