STUDENTS CRITICISE THE SITUATION CONCERNING TRAINING AT STUTTGART LIBRARY
SCHOOL.
     
REPORT OF DISCUSSION AT A WEEKEND SEMINAR, STUTTGART, JAN 81. MANY STUDENTS
HAVE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES IN FINDING ACCOMMODATION BUT,
COMPARED WITH OTHER COURSES, FEW DROP OUT AND STUDENT-STAFF RELATIONSHIPS ARE
GOOD. LIBRARIANSHIP STUDIES SHOULD DEVELOP CRITICAL FACULTIES AND THE ABILITY
TO MAKE CONTACT WITH READERS. THE LIBRARY MUST BECOME A COMMUNICATION CENTRE,
UP TO DATE AND OPEN TO OUTSIDE INFLUENCES. REGIONAL NEEDS SHOULD BE EMPHASISED
RATHER THAN NATIONAL STANDARDISATION. LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES SHOULD CONTAIN NEW
FIELDS OF STUDY, LIKE SOCIAL AND COMMUNICATION SCIENCES. SOME FORMAL LECTURES
SHOULD BE REPLACED BY SMALL STUDY GROUPS, EXAMINATION PROCEDURES SHOULD BE
IMPROVED AND BETTER USE MADE OF PRACTICAL TRAINING PERIODS.
