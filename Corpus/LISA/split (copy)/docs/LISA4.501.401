FANTASTIC POSSIBILITIES FOR GLOBAL INFORMATION TO THE SMALLEST VILLAGE.
     
REPORTS ON A CONFERENCE ON ON-LINE INFORMATION, ORGANISED BY THE BRITISH
LIBRARY AND HELD IN SEPT 81, WITH THE AIM OF EXAMINING RECENT EXPERIMENTS WITH
ON-LINE INFORMATION SERVICE IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, SEEING THEM IN ACTION, AND
DISCUSSING RELATED ASPECTS SUCH AS FEES. DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN DIFFERENT FORMS
OF INFORMATION' FACTS; AND INFORMATION ABOUT INFORMATION, SUCH AS PARTICULAR
BOOKS OR SUBJECTS. TO HANDLE THE STREAM OF INFORMATION, LIBRARIES NEED NEW
TECHNOLOGY. ONLY IF INFORMATION IS ELECTRONICALLY REGISTERED CAN ALL
INFORMATION BE ACCESSIBLE ON-LINE TO EVERYONE. PROBLEMS THEN ARISE OF ACTUALLY
OBTAINING THE INFORMATION AND SELECTING THE AMOUNT NEEDED. STANDARDISATION OF
CATALOGUING AND SYSTEMS IS NEEDED. THE HOLDINGS OF DANISH LIBRARIES SHOULD BE
ELECTRONICALLY REGISTERED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ON-LINE
TO GROUPS WITHIN POLITICS, BUSINESS, AND EDUCATION AND TO INDIVIDUALS. THE
BIROS EXPERIMENT IN ENGLAND SHOWS THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES CAN HANDLE THIS TASK.
THE NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COULD BE THE POINT OF COOPERATION BETWEEN ALL
LIBRARIES.
