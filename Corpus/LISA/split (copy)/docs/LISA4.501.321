THE LITERATURE SEARCH THAT WENT UP IN SMOKE.
     
SINCE 1977, THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS STRESSED THAT AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES
SHOULD BEGIN WITH BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS. BIBLIOTEKSDATA HAS REPLIED THAT THEIR
DEVELOPMENT PLANS AGREE WITH THIS PRIORITY, BUT ADDS THAT LOCAL LIBRARIES MUST
BE FREE TO DECIDE WHICH AUTOMATION SYSTEM TO USE. FEARS THAT BIBLIOTEKSDATA,
IN EFFECT, IS GIVING PRIORITY TO AUTOMATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS, SUCH AS
ISSUES AND ACQUISITIONS, ALTHOUGH THE UNION HAS ARGUED THE NEED FOR TERMINAL
ACCESS FOR LIBRARIES TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE. PROVISION OF SUCH ACCESS
HAS BEEN HELD UP BY THE FACT THAT THE QUESTION OF THE BEST SUBJECT SEARCH
SYSTEM HAS NOT YET BEEN SOLVED. MEANTIME, HOWEVER, ATTEMPTS SHOULD BE MADE TO
PROVIDE TERMINAL ACCESS WITH FREE TEXT SEARCHING, SIMILAR SEARCHING ON
MICROFORM, AND EXPANSION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES WITH SUBJECT WORDS. ARGUES
THAT THE LIMITED RESOURCES SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED ON THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA'
SERVICES.
