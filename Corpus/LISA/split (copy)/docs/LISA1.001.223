COLLECTIONS OF PATENT DOCUMENTATION AND THE WAY SOVIET SPECIALISTS NEED THEM.

THE SOVIET PATENT DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM COMPRISES COLLECTIONS AT 4 LEVELS' THE
VERY COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTIONS OF THE ALL-UNION PATENT-TECHNICAL LIBRARY
(VPTB); INDUSTRY BRANCH ORIENTED FILES; REGIONAL FILES; AND LOCAL FILES OF
ORGANISATIONS AND FACTORIES. THE VPTB FILES FORM THE BASIS FOR PRODUCING
RUSSIAN-LANGUAGE ABSTRACTS OF FOREIGN INVENTIONS, FOR MICROFILMING INDUSTRIAL
DESIGNS AND UTILITY MODELS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES, AND FOR ISSUING VARIOUS
REFERENCE AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PUBLICATIONS. THE PATENT FILE SYSTEM IS
BEING IMPROVED CONTINUOUSLY. THE PHILOSOPHY GOVERNING THIS AND TECHNIQUES FOR
SELECTING FOREIGN PATENT DOCUMENTS FOR ACQUISITION ARE DESCRIBED.
