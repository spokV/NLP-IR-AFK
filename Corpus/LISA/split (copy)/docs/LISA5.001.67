LIBRARY WORK WITH FOREIGN WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN HAMBURG PUBLIC
LIBRARIES.

IN HAMBURG LIVE ABOUT 145,000 FOREIGNERS, MAINLY FROM TURKEY, YUGOSLAVIA,
PORTUGAL, ITALY, GREECE AND SPAIN. ONE LIBRARIAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 25,000
BOOKS, TAPES, NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS IN 6 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES PROVIDED ON
AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF 200,000 DM IN THE CENTRAL LIBRARY AND IN BRANCHES SERVING
AREAS WITH A LARGE IMMIGRANT POPULATION. THE MAIN STOCK EMPHASIS SO FAR HAS
BEEN ON FICTION FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN; NON-FICTION STOCKS IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGES WILL NOW BE EXPANDED SINCE INFORMATION IN THEM IS NOT ALWAYS
AVAILABLE IN GERMAN TEXTS. IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT
FOREIGN BOOK MARKETS AND GERMANS KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE WORKS THEMSELVES SINCE
FEW TRANSLATIONS ARE AVAILABLE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE THE CULTURAL
IDENTITY OF FOREIGN RESIDENTS AND TO HELP THEM INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY INTO
WEST GERMAN SOCIETY.
