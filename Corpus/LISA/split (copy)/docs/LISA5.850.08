TRANSPORT SCHEMES FOR INTERLIBRARY LENDING' THE UK EXPERIENCE.

WHERE POSTAL SERVICES ARE SLOW, UNRELIABLE OR EXPENSIVE, DEDICATED TRANSPORT
SCHEMES FOR INTERLENDING PURPOSES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED; THEIR USEFULNESS WILL
VARY FROM 1 COUNTRY TO ANOTHER, ACCORDING TO LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN THE UK,
FEASIBILITY STUDIES WERE FOLLOWED BY THE SETTING UP OF TRANSPORT SCHEMES IN A
NUMBER OF THE UK LIBRARY REGIONS, AND A NATIONAL SCHEME LINKING THE REGIONS
WAS ENVISAGED. TRANSPORT SCHEMES WERE NOT CONSIDERED WORTHWHILE IN THE LARGER
REGIONS WITH LESS INTERLENDING ACTIVITY. A METHODOLOGY FOR SETTING UP SCHEMES
HAS BEEN DEVISED. THE PRESENT TRANSPORT SCHEMES ARE FINANCIALLY COMPETITIVE
AND LIKELY TO REMAIN SO. UK EXPERIENCE MIGHT PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING
POTENTIAL SCHEMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
