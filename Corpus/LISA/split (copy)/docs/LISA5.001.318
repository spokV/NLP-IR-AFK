THE REPAIR WORKSHOP OF HAMBURG STATE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

FOUNDED IN 1960, THE WORKSHOP WAS 1ST CONCERNED MAINLY WITH BOOKBINDING; A FEW
YEARS LATER A SEPARATE SECTION WAS OPENED FOR DOCUMENT PRESERVATION AND
RESTORATION OF PAPYRI AND OTHER MANUSCRIPTS. TOTAL ESTIMATES FOR DAMAGED
MATERIAL IN THE EARLY 1960S WERE OVER 422,000 DM, A SUM WHICH AT THAT TIME
COULD NOT BE MET. THE FLOODS OF 1962 IN HAMBURG CAUSED PARTICULAR PROBLEMS.
SINCE 1978 EXTRA FINANCIAL HELP HAS COME FROM THE VOLKSWAGEN FOUNDATION. THE
WORK IS NOT ONLY EXPENSIVE BUT ALSO EXCEPTIONALLY TIME-CONSUMING. THE WORKSHOP
IS INVOLVED IN EXHIBITIONS, TRAINING COURSES FOR LIBRARY STUDENTS AND NATIONAL
AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES; A COLLECTION OF SUBJECT LITERATURE HAS ALSO
BEEN DEVELOPED.
