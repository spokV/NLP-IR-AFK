LIBRARY SERVICES TO PATIENTS IN SCOTTISH HOSPITALS.

SCOTLAND'S 15 HEALTH BOARDS, 41 LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND 2 VOLUNTARY
ORGANISATIONS WERE CIRCULARISED FOR INFORMATION ON LIBRARY SERVICES TO
PATIENTS IN SCOTTISH HOSPITALS. OF THE 41 LOCAL AUTHORITIES, 5 DID NOT REPLY,
AND 7 HAD NO SERVICE, LEAVING 70% OF AUTHORITIES PROVIDING A SERVICE TO 62
HOSPITALS. THIS IS 17&H% OF SCOTLAND'S 348 HOSPITALS. ONLY 2 AUTHORITIES
PROVIDE A FULL-TIME QUALIFIED LIBRARIAN. IN MANY INSTANCES IT IS THE WARD
SISTER WHO ADMINISTERS THE DEPOSIT COLLECTION LEFT BY THE LOCAL LIBRARY.
FURTHER DETAILS OF SERVICES ARE GIVEN, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON SERVICES IN
THE CUNNINGHAME DISTRICT, WHICH IS IN RECEIPT OF AN URBAN AID GRANT FOR THE
EXPANSION OF SERVICES TO THE HOUSEBOUND AND TO HOSPITAL PATIENTS. APPENDED IS
'AN EX-PATIENT'S VIEW' BY J. COLLINS.
