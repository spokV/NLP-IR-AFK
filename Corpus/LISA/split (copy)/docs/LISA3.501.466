FACTORS AFFECTING DOCUMENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS' PRESENT AND FUTURE.
     
THE PAPER EXAMINES THE CURRENT STATE OF DOCUMENT DELIVERY AND ANALYSES THE
FACTORS INVOLVED IN SOME EXISTING NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN SERVICES. IT
SUGGESTS THAT FACTORS STUDIED SO FAR ARE NOT THOSE WHICH ARE REALLY IMPORTANT,
AND FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION AND
MISCONCEPTIONS SURROUNDING DEBATE ON DOCUMENT DELIVERY. SOME FACTORS ARE
PROPOSED FOR EXAMINATION WHICH ARE MORE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE DESIGN OF DOCUMENT
DELIVERY SYSTEMS.
