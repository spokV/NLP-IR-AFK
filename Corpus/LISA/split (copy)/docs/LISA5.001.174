LIBRARIES AND BUILDINGS. INTERRELATIONSHIPS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE HEIDELBERG
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

THE GROWTH OF LIBRARIES IN THIS CENTURY HAS LED TO REGULAR REBUILDING AND
REHOUSING OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE AT THE
HEIDELBERG UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. THE LIBRARY WAS BUILT IN 1905 AND IS STILL
HOUSED IN THE ORIGINAL BUILDING WHICH IS NOW PROTECTED AS A LISTED BUILDING.
IN THE 1950S SOME INTERIOR STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS WERE MADE TO IMPROVE THE
GENERAL EFFICIENCY OF THE LIBRARY. FROM 1959 TO 1978 VARIOUS PLANS WERE MADE
FOR NEW UNIVERSITY LIBRARY BUILDINGS. THESE INCLUDED AN EXTENSION TO THE
LIBRARY IN PART OF THE OLD TOWN OF HEIDELBERG, A NEW BUILDING ON A NEW SITE TO
SERVE THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC FACULTIES AND SMALL EXTENSIONS FOR EXTRA
STORAGE. FINALLY DUE TO PLANNING RESTRICTIONS IN THE OLD TOWN AND THE 1966/67
RECESSION THE LIBRARY REMAINED AS IT WAS WITH TEMPORARY USE OF A MEDICAL
INSTITUTE BUILDING WHICH INVOLVES TRANSPORT PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE 2 SITES.
