PRAGMATIC ASPECTS OF INQUIRY.
     
(PHD DISSERTATION-UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY). AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE SOME
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH PEOPLE SEARCH FOR INFORMATION
WHICH THEY KNOW OR BELIEVE TO EXIST. ANALYSES LANGUAGE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF
A SEMANTIC THEORY THAT WOULD HELP EXPLAIN THE PROCESS OF INQUIRY; DEMONSTRATES
THAT EVEN SUCH STRAIGHTFORWARD USES OF LANGUAGE AS AUTHORS' NAMES AND
CITATIONS ARE VERY COMPLEX LINGUISTIC PHENOMENA; ANALYSES GENERAL METHODS USED
IN THE CONDUCT OF INQUIRY; AND IDENTIFIES AND CONSIDERS THE MAJOR CONSEQUENCES
OF THE PRAGMATIC THEORY OF INQUIRY.
