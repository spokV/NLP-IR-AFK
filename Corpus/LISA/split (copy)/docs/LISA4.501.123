NEWSLETTERS HAS BEEN BUILT UP AT THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARY
IN BULGARIA. IN 1979 ABOUT 350,000 ITEMS WERE LISTED. THEY WERE SUPPLIED BY
13,000 COMPANIES FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY WERE FROM WEST
GERMANY, MATERIALS IN GERMAN MAINTAINING A STEADY 36%. BOTH ENGLISH (30%) AND
RUSSIAN (9%) ARE ON THE INCREASE AND WHILE 15% OF THE CATALOGUES ARE IN
FRENCH, THE TREND SHOWS A SLOW DECLINE. NEW ACQUISITIONS ARE LISTED IN A
SPECIAL BULLETIN PUBLISHED TWICE A MONTH AND DISTRIBUTED TO SOME 600
SUBSCRIBERS. REGULAR EXHIBITIONS TAKE PLACE AND WITH THIS EXTENSIVE COLLECTION
