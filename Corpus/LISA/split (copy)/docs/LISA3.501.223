DOES TRONDHEIM NEED A PUBLIC LIBRARY? OPEN LETTER TO THE PARTY MEMBERS IN THE
TOWN COUNCIL.
     
THE STAFF OF TRONDHEIM PUBLIC LIBRARY, NORWAY, CONSIDER THE LATEST
POSTPONEMENT (TILL AFTER 1982) OF THE PLANNED NEW LIBRARY TOTALLY
IRRESPONSIBLE. HAVING LONG TOLERATED UNSATISFACTORY CONDITIONS IN THE
EXPECTATION OF IMPROVEMENT, THEY NOW DEMAND THAT THE PRESENT LIBRARY SHOULD BE
BROUGHT UP TO CURRENT STANDARDS OF HEALTH AND WORK ENVIRONMENT CONDITIONS,
THOUGH EVEN THIS WOULD NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. MUCH OF THE
BOOKSTOCK IS HOUSED ELSEWHERE FOR LACK OF SPACE, WHICH TOGETHER WITH STAFF
SHORTAGES MAKES FOR UNSATISFACTORY PUBLIC SERVICE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXTEND
SERVICES TO THE ELDERLY, HANDICAPPED AND OTHER DISADVANTAGED GROUPS. ONLY A
NEW LIBRARY CAN BRING TRONDHEIM INTO LINE WITH OTHER NORWEGIAN CITY LIBRARY
SERVICES.
