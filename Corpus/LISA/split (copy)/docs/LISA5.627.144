THE INFORMATION USER IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY-A STUDY OF THE EDUCATIONAL
NEED AND PROVISION.

THERE IS AMPLE RECORD THAT INFORMATION HANDLING OCCUPIES A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF
PRODUCTION TIME AND THAT POOR PERFORMANCE IN THIS FIELD IS AT THE ROOT OF MANY
OF THE INDUSTRY'S PROBLEMS. SUCH PROBLEMS FALL INTO 2 MAIN CATEGORIES. THE 1ST
RELATES TO BUILDINGS THEMSELVES AND CONCERNS PHYSICAL (COLLAPSE, FIRE, LEAKS,
CONDENSATION) AND SPATIAL (SHORT LIFE, TIGHT FIT, HIGH ENERGY) FAILURE. THE
2ND CATEGORY CONCERNS ORGANISATIONAL FAILURES. CLEARLY IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH
THESE CATEGORIES COULD BE BENEFICIAL.
