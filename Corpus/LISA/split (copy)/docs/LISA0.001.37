THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY SERVICE AT DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY.

THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY SERVICE, DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY, HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA, WAS
ESTABLISHED IN 1969, IN RESPONSE TO THE NEED FOR LIBRARY EDUCATION WITHIN
CANADA'S ATLANTIC PROVINCES. A PRAGMATIC EDUCATIONAL APPROACH ENCOURAGES
STUDENTS TO WORK WITH BOOKS AS MATERIAL OBJECTS, WITH COURSES IN PRINTING
HISTORY, BOOKBINDING AND PRESERVATION. THE SCHOOL'S EMPHASIS ON THE PHYSICAL
BOOK IS SEEN AS AN EXAMPLE ALL LIBRARY SCHOOLS SHOULD FOLLOW.
