THE ADDITIONAL DIMENSION' DAVID GERARD ON SOUND, VISION AND THE LOST
CREATIVITY OF THE LIBRARIAN.

CALLS ON LIBRARIANS TO MAKE FULL USE OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA AND BECOME AGAIN, FOR
THE 1ST TIME SINCE THE LIBRARIANS OF ANCIENT GREECE, CREATIVE INTERMEDIARIES
AND PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSMITTING INFORMATION. SUCH MEDIA ARE
OPEN, VULNERABLE, CAN BE INTERRUPTED, ERASED, RESHAPED, EVEN FALSIFIED-THEY
BRING USERS CLOSER TO REAL EXPERIENCES, OFFERING AN ACTUALITY DENIED TO THEM
IN PRINT. LIKE LIFE, ELECTRONIC MEDIA ARE TRANSIENT. PRINT, MEANWHILE, HAS AN
AIR OF PERMANENCE AND AUTHORITY WHEN IT REALLY REPRESENTS OBSOLESCENCE.
