DISTRIBUTION OF ALL SERIALS (LIDAS) DEVELOPED FOR THE CENTRAL MANAGEMENT
LIBRARY OF THE UK CIVIL SERVICE DEPARTMENT. THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE SYSTEM
ARE' THAT SERIALS ARE CHECKED IN QUICKLY AND EASILY ON THE TERMINAL, PRODUCING
DISTRIBUTION LABELS AND CIRCULATION LISTS, SHELF MARKS FOR COPIES FOR THE
LIBRARY AND ANY RELEVANT INFORMATION THE CLERICAL STAFF NEED TO BE AWARE OF
WHEN RECEIVING ISSUES OF PARTICULAR SERIALS; THAT A NUMBER OF STANDARD REPORTS
BE READILY AVAILABLE; THAT OVERDUE AND MISSING ISSUES BE AUTOMATICALLY SPOTTED
AND REPORTED ON; THAT AD-HOC ENQUIRIES CAN BE QUICKLY ANSWERED BY ACCESSING
THE DATA BASE AND GENERATING ONE-OFF REPORTS; THAT IT REPLACES KARDEX AND
OTHER MANUAL SYSTEMS; THAT IT IS SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND CAN BE MAINTAINED BY
LIBRARY STAFF; THAT IT IS EASY TO USE; AND THAT IT REMAINS FLEXIBLE.
