ON EMPIRICAL FOUNDATIONS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE.
     
IN THIS STUDY OF EMPIRICAL FOUNDATIONS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE, PERTINENT
EMPIRICAL LAWS AND HYPOTHESES, WHICH HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL LITERATURE, WERE CATALOGUED, DESCRIBED, AND ANALYSED FOR THEIR
DEPENDENCIES AND RELATIONSHIPS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESEARCH WAS TO IDENTIFY
A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE, DERIVED FROM EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONS OF INFORMATION
PHENOMENA AND REPRESENTATIVE OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AS A DISTINCT SCIENTIFIC
DISCIPLINE. THIS BODY OF KNOWLEDGE DEALS WITH CONCEPTS SUCH AS INFORMATION
VALUE, RELEVANCE, AGING OF INFORMATION, GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE, OBSOLESCENCE,
INFORMATION SCATTER, PRODUCTIVITY OF INFORMATION SOURCES AND INFORMATION FLOW.
