MAKE LIBRARIES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL!.

6 YEARS AFTER THE GOVERNMENT AGREED ON A NEW CULTURAL POLICY, NO PROPOSALS FOR
SUCH A POLICY ON THE NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED EXIST. DESPITE OUR CONCERN FOR
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MANY HANDICAPPED ARE DENIED ACCESS TO THE SPOKEN AND
PRINTED WORD. LIBRARIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE THEIR CULTURAL ACTIVITIES
AVAILABLE TO ALL. DIRECT PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT THE HANDICAPPED CAN
REACH THE LIBRARY, ENTER IT AND STAY THERE. BUT IMPROVED BUILDINGS AND
TRANSPORT CANNOT REPLACE THE DOMICILIARY LIBRARY SERVICE. INDIRECT
ACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT LIBRARY ACTIVITIES AND MEDIA MUST BE ADAPTED TO REACH
NEW GROUPS. 'EASY READERS' ARE AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A MEDIUM AND THEIR
PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION THROUGH LIBRARIES ARE DISCUSSED. THE NEW STATE
LIBRARY FOR SPEECH AND BRAILLE PRINTING IS THE 1ST STAGE IN PROVISION FOR THE
BLIND AND PARTIALLY-SIGHTED; THE NEXT IS THE INCREASED DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH
MATERIAL TO OTHER GROUPS.
