LIBRARY SERVICES TO PHYSICALLY DISABLED PERSONS.
     
THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR FOR DISABLED PERSONS 1981 HAS DRAWN THE ATTENTION TO
THE 8% OF THE WORLD POPULATION WHO ARE DISABLED IN SOME WAY. CONSIDERABLE
ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE LIBRARY NEEDS OF THESE PEOPLE. IN ORDER TO
OFFER THEM EQUAL RIGHTS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AS ABLE PERSONS IN THE
LIBRARY, SEVERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PHYSICAL LAY-OUT AND EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE
CONSIDERED. BLIND PERSONS HAVE A WELL-COORDINATED SOUTH AFRICAN LIBRARY
SERVICE WITH BOOKS IN BRAILLE OR MOON PRINT AND BOOKS ON TAPE AT THEIR
DISPOSAL. ALMOST ALL OTHER DISABLED PERSONS CAN RELY WITH CONFIDENCE ON THE
SERVICE OF THEIR NEARBY LIBRARY. SPECIAL ATTEMPTS WILL BE MADE TO SUPPLY THEM
WITH BOOKS, IN GENERAL AS WELL AS AIMED AT THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS. E.G. HOW TO
ADAPT TO THEIR WAY OF LIVING AS DISABLED PERSONS (DEALING WITH THE PRACTICAL
ASPECTS LIKE CLOTHING AND HOUSING) AND HOW TO ACCEPT REALITY (HEALING OF THE
MIND).
