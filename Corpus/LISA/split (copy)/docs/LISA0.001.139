CITATION ANALYSIS SIGNIFICANCE OF SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS.

THE APPLICATION OF METHODS OF QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO
EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS ON ONE ANOTHER. THESE METHODS ARE
USED TO DETERMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SIMILAR SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS BY THEIR
CROSS-CITATIONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DATA FROM THE JOURNAL CITATION REPORTS
(JCR). THEY ALSO HELP TO IMPROVE THE JCR STRUCTURE AND WIDEN ITS USES FOR THE
EVALUATION OF SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS. THESE METHODS ARE APPLIED TO ANALYSE
CRITICALLY THE PRINCIPLES OF RANKING JOURNALS IN PACKAGE 1 AND THE TABULAR
CONTENTS OF JCR'S PACKAGES 2 AND 3, AS WELL AS TO STUDY FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION
OF THE JOURNALS BOTH IN TIME AND SPACE.
