THE UNIVERSITY IS A SCHOOL OF READING.

STUDENTS AT THE STUDENCHESKOE KONSTRUKTORSKOE BYURO AVIAMODELIZMA, (STUDENTS'
AIRCRAFT MODELLING CONSTRUCTION BUREAU), START BY READING THE LITERATURE ON A
PROBLEM; THE ROAD TO SCIENCE STARTS IN THE LIBRARY. THE UNIVERSITY COURSE ON
STUDENTS' EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH WORK INCULCATES THE READING HABIT, INDEPENDENT
WORK WITH BOOKS. FOR BEST RESULTS STUDENTS SHOULD ABSTRACT THE IMPORTANT PARTS
OF THEIR READING, THINKING IT OVER UNHURRIEDLY. CREATIVE INTERACTION WITH THE
TEXT IS MOST IMPORTANT. AFTER LECTURES, THE NEXT STAGE IS THE LIBRARY,
FOLLOWING UP POINTS MADE IN THE LECTURES. TACTFUL LIBRARIANS HELP READERS
CHOOSE A BOOK AT THEIR LEVEL OF COMPETENCE AND, IN A SHORT CONVERSATION, CAN
AROUSE STRONG INTEREST IN A BOOK OR, CONVERSELY, SWITCH A READER OVER TO AN
ALTERNATIVE CHOICE.
