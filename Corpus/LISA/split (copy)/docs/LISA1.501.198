THE DEVELOPMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL LIBRARIES AS A BASIS FOR GOVERNMENTAL
INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
     
DESCRIBES THE PRESENT FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENTAL LIBRARIES WHICH GIVES THEM
INDEPENDENCE, AND OUTLINES A POSSIBLE GOVERNMENTAL INFORMATION SYSTEM WHOSE
FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE RECEPTION, ADAPTATION, CONCENTRATION, STORAGE, COMBINATION
AND SERVICE. A GOVERNMENTAL INFORMATION SYSTEM IS ABLE TO FULFIL TASKS WHICH
COULD NOT BE FULFILLED UP TO NOW; AND IT WILL BE UP TO FUTURE USERS TO
DISCOVER THE QUALITIES OF SUCH A NEW INFORMATION SYSTEM WITHIN A GOVERNMENTAL
LIBRARY.
