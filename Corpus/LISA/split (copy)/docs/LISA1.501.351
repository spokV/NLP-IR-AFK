TO GROW OR NOT TO GROW?.
     
ENUMERATES AND COMMENTS ON THE MANY FACTORS THAT CAUSE INCREASED NEED FOR
ACADEMIC LIBRARY SPACE. SINCE THE COLLECTION OCCUPIES ONLY FROM 25-45% OF THE
FLOORSPACE IN LARGE ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, THESE OTHER FACTORS MUST ALSO BE
STUDIED AND REMEDIED IN ORDER TO LIMIT BUILDING GROWTH. THE FOLLOWING MEASURES
TO SLOW THE INCREASE IN STORAGE SPACE ARE REVIEWED IN DETAIL' WEEDING;
ZERO-GROWTH; COMPACT STORAGE; COORDINATED ACQUISITIONS; MINIATURISATION. IN
CONNECTION WITH THE ARRANGEMENT OF STORED MATERIALS, DETAILED ARGUMENTS ARE
CITED WHY BROWSING IS AN INSUFFICIENT RETRIEVAL DEVICE FOR SERIOUS RESEARCH.
THE POINT IS MADE THAT A COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE MEASURES IS NEEDED TO REDUCE
SPACE PRESSURES INHERITED FROM THE PAST. FURTHERMORE, IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF
THE STUDIES SHOWING THAT A HIGH PROPORTION OF ACQUIRED WORKS IS RARELY IF EVER
USED, A MORE LIMITED AND REGIONALLY COORDINATED SELECTION POLICY IS NEEDED TO
REDUCE FUTURE SPACE PRESSURES.
