AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIANSHIP AND DOCUMENTATION AS A PROFESSION.

TRANSLATION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT A CONGRESS OF THE IAALD IN MANILA IN 1980,
GIVING A GENERAL VIEW OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE AGRICULTURAL
FIELD IN RELATION TO LIBRARIANSHIP IN GENERAL AND IN OTHER FIELDS. A
PRELIMINARY DEFINITION SETS OUT THE NATURE OF THE WORK OF THE AGRICULTURAL
LIBRARIAN, AND THEN THE SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIELD ARE DISCUSSED IN
DETAIL' ITS INTERDISCIPLINARY NATURE, THE WIDE RANGE OF TYPES OF
DOCUMENTATION, ITS INTERNATIONAL CHARACTER, AND THE NEED TO DISSEMINATE
INFORMATION TO A DIVERSE COMMUNITY REPRESENTING A WIDE VARIETY OF EDUCATIONAL
BACKGROUNDS. THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF EXISTING SERVICES ARE EXAMINED
WITH REFERENCE TO INFORMATION RESOURCES AND COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES, WHERE THE
EXTENT TO WHICH NETWORK OPPORTUNITIES ARE USED DEPENDS ON THE SCALE AND FOCUS
OF SERVICES OFFERED, AND THIS IN TURN INFLUENCES PROFESSIONAL DUTIES. THE
EDUCATION AND SKILLS ESSENTIAL FOR THE P ROFESSIONAL ARE ANALYSED IN RELATION
TO THE CHANGES IN INFORMATION AND LIBRARY SERVICES IN GENERAL CAUSED BY SOCIAL
AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH HAVE CREATED A NEED FOR ALTERATIONS IN
LIBRARY SCHOOL CURRICULA AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAMMES OF CONTINUING
EDUCATION FOR PRACTISING LIBRARIANS. FINALLY POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS TO MEET
THE DEMANDS OF THE FUTURE ARE CONSIDERED.
