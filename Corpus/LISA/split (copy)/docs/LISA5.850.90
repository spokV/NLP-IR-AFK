THE USE OF AUTOMATIC INDEXING FOR AUTHORITY CONTROL.

THESAURUS-BASED AUTOMATIC INDEXING AND AUTOMATIC AUTHORITY CONTROL SHARE
COMMON GROUND AS WORD-MATCHING PROCESSES. TO DEMONSTRATE THE RESEMBLANCE, AN
EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM UTILISING AUTOMATIC INDEXING AS ITS CORE PROCESS WAS
IMPLEMENTED TO PERFORM AUTHORITY CONTROL ON A COLLECTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RECORDS. DETAILS OF THE SYSTEM ARE GIVEN AND RESULTS DISCUSSED. THE BENEFITS
OF EXPLOITING THE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE 2 SYSTEMS ARE EXAMINED.
