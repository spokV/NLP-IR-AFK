TEACHING THE THEORIES OF MANAGEMENT IN AN AFRICAN LIBRARY SCHOOL.
     
DESCRIBES THE AUTHOR'S REACTIONS TO HIS ATTEMPTS TO TEACH THE SUBJECT OF
ALLEGED OBSTACLES TO SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT IN AN AFRICAN LIBRARY SCHOOL.
SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS APPROPRIATE TO THE LOCAL SCENE WERE OF
PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE IN THE STUDIES. EARLY SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT THEORY
INSISTED ON THE NEED FOR A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF ALL INSTITUTIONS, AND
ANYTHING WHICH LEADS TO THE SAME KIND OF STUDIES IN AFRICAN SOCIETIES SHOULD
BE ENCOURAGED.
