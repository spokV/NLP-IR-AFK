CRISIS-CENTRED, ISSUE-BASED' THE LONELINESS OF DISTANCE LEARNING.

ARGUES THAT UK LIBRARIES AND THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION CONTINUING
EDUCATION HAVE THE SAME STAPLE CUSTOMER GROUP. AS PROVISION OF LOCAL AUTHORITY

BENEFIT BOTH ORGANISATIONS TO COOPERATE AND MAINTAIN A 'HIGH PROFILE'. FOR
THEIR PART, LIBRARIES SHOULD PRESENT THEMSELVES AS PROVIDERS AND PARTNERS IN
ADULT EDUCATION RATHER THAN AS SERVICING AGENTS; AGGRESSIVELY MARKET MATERIALS
ASSOCIATED WITH CONTINUING EDUCATION SERIES; AND USE THEIR CLOSENESS TO THE
COMMUNITY TO ATTRACT AND SERVE THE WORKING CLASS. WITH ITS 4,500 OUTLETS, THE
UK LIBRARY SYSTEM IS A SLEEPING COMMUNITY EDUCATION GIANT-THE GIANT MUST
AWAKE.
