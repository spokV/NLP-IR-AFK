A COMPARISON OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS AND NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL
HEALTH DATABASES.
     
A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO COMPARE THE COVERAGE AND FEATURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL
ABSTRACTS AND NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH (NIMH) ON-LINE DATA BASES.
THE FOLLOWING AREAS WERE COMPARED: CITATION OVERLAP, JOURNAL COVERAGE,
DESCRIPTIVE INDEXING, TREATMENT OF IDENTICAL RECORDS, AND SUBJECT COVERAGE.
RESULTS DEMONSTRATE A 49.0% CITATION OVERLAP BETWEEN NIMH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL
ABSTRACTS AND INDICATE A COMPLEMENTARY, NOT COMPETITIVE, RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
THE FILES.
