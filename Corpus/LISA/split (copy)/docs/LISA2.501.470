ILLITERACY IN THE GERMAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC.
     
REPORT ON A CONFERENCE, HELD BY EDUCATIONALISTS, SOCIOLOGISTS AND LIBRARIANS
IN BREMEN, NOV 80, ON ILLITERACY AMONG CHILDREN AND ADULTS. RECENT CAMPAIGNS
AGAINST ILLITERACY ABROAD SHOW RESULTS FAR IN ADVANCE OF THOSE HITHERTO
ACHIEVED IN WEST GERMANY. RESEARCHERS MUST FIND OUT WHO THE ILLITERATE ARE AND
THE BEST WAYS TO REACH THEM; SOME WORK IS ALREADY BEING DONE BY STAFF AT ADULT
EDUCATION CENTRES, PENAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE LOCAL PRESS. PROBLEMS OF STAFF
AND MONEY SHORTAGES MUST BE OVERCOME AND BEGINNERS' READING BOOKS PRODUCED
SUITABLE FOR ADULTS. LIBRARIANS CAN HELP BY WORKING WITH SCHOOLS AND
KINDERGARTENS TO ALLEVIATE THE FEAR OF ENTERING A LIBRARY FELT BY MANY PEOPLE;
THEY CAN PROVIDE SUITABLE MEDIA TO HELP SCHOOL TEACHERS, ADULT EDUCATION
CENTRES AND THE READERS THEMSELVES AND ASSIST IN MEDIA PRODUCTION BY
COOPERATING WITH AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS.
