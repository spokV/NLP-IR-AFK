LENINIST PRINCIPLES IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND LIBRARIES IN CUBA.
     
OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN CUBA SINCE 1959. THE MAJOR
ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS PERIOD WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
NETWORK WITH THE NATIONAL LIBRARY JOSE MARTI AT THE HEAD. THE FUNCTION OF
LIBRARIES HAS CHANGED FROM MERE COLLECTIONS OF BOOKS TO LIVING INSTITUTIONS
TAKING PART IN THE NATIONAL CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. PUBLIC
LIBRARIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE LITERACY CAMPAIGN. EXTENSION
ACTIVITIES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR WORK ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN'S
LIBRARIES. STATISTICAL DATA ILLUSTRATE LIBRARY PROVISION IN THE PAST 20 YEARS.
