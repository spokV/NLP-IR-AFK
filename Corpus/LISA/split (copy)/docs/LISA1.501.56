FIFTY YEARS OF MOBILE LIBRARIES IN MANCHESTER, 1931-1981.
     
THE POPULATION OF MANCHESTER EXPANDED RAPIDLY IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING WORLD WAR
I AND THERE WAS A DEMAND FOR MORE BRANCH LIBRARIES. THE NECESSARY MONEY WAS
NOT AVAILABLE, SO THE CITY LIBRARIAN SUGGESTED A TRAVELLING LIBRARY ON THE
LINES OF THOSE ALREADY IN USE IN THE USA AND THE UK'S 1ST MOBILE LIBRARY TOOK
TO THE STREETS OF MANCHESTER IN JULY 1931. THE SERVICE WAS WELL-USED AND
EXPANDED, WAS SUSPENDED DURING WORLD WAR II, AND WAS RESUMED IN 1948. IT IS
NOW AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CITY'S LIBRARY SERVICE, SERVING AREAS UNABLE TO
SUPPORT A BRANCH LIBRARY, THOSE UNABLE TO VISIT A BRANCH LIBRARY, AND AREAS
WHERE CUTS IN EXPENDITURE HAVE FORCED BRANCH LIBRARY CLOSURES.
