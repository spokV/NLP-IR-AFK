LIBRARY SCIENCE IN THEORY AND PRACTICE.

IN THE USA, UK AND COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, LIBRARY SCIENCE IS NOW FULLY
ESTABLISHED AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE AND INCLUDED AMONGST UNIVERSITY
FACULTIES. SINCE THE 19TH CENTURY, HOWEVER, OPINION IN WEST GERMANY HAS BEEN
DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER LIBRARY SCIENCE HAS ITS OWN THEORETIC BASIS OR WHETHER
IT CONSISTS OF PURELY PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE. EXAMINATION OF THE RESPECTIVE
ARGUMENTS SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARY SCIENCE CAN BE REGARDED AS AN APPLIED SCIENCE
CLOSELY LINKED WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES, E.G. INFORMATION SCIENCE,
COMMUNICATION, CYBERNETICS AND LINGUISTICS. HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP EMPHASISED HITHERTO SHOULD PLAY ONLY A SUBORDINATE ROLE; THE
MAIN EMPHASIS MUST BE ON SCIENTIFICALLY BASED, ECONOMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION
LINKED WITH RESEARCH. COLOGNE IS THE ONLY GERMAN UNIVERSITY POSSESSING A
LIBRARY SCIENCE FACULTY; MORE SUCH FACULTIES ARE NEEDED TO PRODUCE LIBRARIANS
OF THE REQUIRED CALIBRE.
