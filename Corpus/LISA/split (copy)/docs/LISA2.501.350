REVISED VERSION OF PART OF A PAPER PRESENTED TO THE INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON
NATIONAL DOCUMENT PROVISION, BOSTON SPA, 22-24 SEPT 80. 4 TYPES OF NATIONAL
INTERLENDING SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. MODELS A, B, AND C REPRESENT
PLANNED CENTRALISATION OR DECENTRALISATION. MODEL D IS UNPLANNED
DECENTRALISATION. IT OCCURS FREQUENTLY AND, IF THE TIME AND MONEY NECESSARY
FOR BETTER MODELS ARE LACKING, AN UPGRADED VERSION CAN BE USED. THE COST OF
THE NECESSARY UNION CATALOGUES CAN BE DECREASED BY AUTOMATION. SPEED OF SUPPLY
BY AND GOODWILL OF NET LENDERS CAN BE IMPROVED BY COST RECOVERY. ALTERNATIVE
METHODS OF PAYMENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED, INCLUDING A SYSTEM BASED ON AN
INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEE FUND.
