A REVIEWER'S STORY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. A REVIEWER LOOKS AT SELECTION,
DESCRIPTION, AND CRITICISM OF THE CHILDREN'S BOOKS WHICH SHE MUST DECIDE TO
RECOMMEND OR NOT RECOMMEND FOR LIBRARY PURCHASE. WOVEN THROUGHOUT THE
DISCUSSION IS A PERSONALISED ACCOUNT OF EXPERIENCES THAT FORCE THE REVIEWER TO
CONSIDER THE WHOLE RANGE OF POSSIBLE REACTIONS TO CONTROVERSIAL MATERIAL FROM
VIEWPOINTS OF CHILDREN, PARENTS, LIBRARIANS, EDUCATORS, PUBLISHERS, AUTHORS,
AND ARTISTS. IN ADDITION TO THE NATURE OF THE BOOK AND THE PROSPECTIVE READER
THE REVIEWER NEEDS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HER OWN PREPARATION AND EXPERIENCE FOR
EVALUATING AND REVIEWING EACH BOOK.
