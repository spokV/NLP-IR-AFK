ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRAINTS AS A HINDRANCE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOCUMENTATION
SERVICES.

DISCUSSES WHY DOCUMENTATION SERVICES AT PRESENT ARE MEETING ADMINISTRATIVE
OPPOSITION TO EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT, AND SOME POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS, WITH
REFERENCE TO CLASSICAL ORGANISATION THEORY. EXAMINES THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND
ECONOMIC OBSTACLES TO ACCESSIBILITY OF INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF
SERVICES, AND PROPOSES THAT ORGANISATION PERFORMANCE BE RATED ACCORDING TO ITS
USE, NOT ITS OBJECTIVES. IF THIS IS ACCEPTED, THE INCREASED USE OF INFORMATION
NETWORKS WOULD PROVIDE A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO CURRENT PROBLEMS, BUT CERTAINLY
GREATER EMPHASIS ON MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES IS ESSENTIAL IN TRAINING INFORMATION
PROFESSIONALS.
