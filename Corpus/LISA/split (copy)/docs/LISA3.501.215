15 DEC 80. ATTEMPTS TO ADVANCE THE REEXAMINATION OF CONTINUING EDUCATION ON
BEHALF OF THE REFERENCE LIBRARIAN IN THE ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARY.
REFERENCE MATERIALS, REFERENCE TECHNIQUES, INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS AND SUBJECT
KNOWLEDGE SHOULD ALL BE CONSIDERED IN CONTINUING EDUCATION IN LIBRARIANSHIP.
TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SERVICE THEY PERFORM, REFERENCE LIBRARIANS SHOULD
INTEREST THEMSELVES IN CONTINUING EDUCATION. THEY MUST ADAPT TO CHANGE OR THEY
WILL BECOME IRRELEVANT AND INCAPABLE OF GIVING PROPER SERVICE.
