SINCE TANZANIA BECAME INDEPENDENT IN 1961 THE LIBRARY SYSTEM HAS BEEN
DEVELOPED AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. IN 1963 THE LIBRARY
SERVICES BOARD ACT WAS PASSED WHICH LED TO THE NATIONAL CENTRAL LIBRARY IN DAR
ES SALAAM BEING BUILT IN 1967. THE LIBRARY STARTED WITH A STOCK OF 136,000 AND
IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE TANZANIA LIBRARY SERVICES. FROM THIS CENTRE OTHER
LIBRARIES WERE PLANNED, FIRSTLY IN THE DISTRICT TOWNS, THEN ON A SMALLER SCALE
IN RURAL AREAS. CONVERTED LORRIES SERVED AS MOBILE LIBRARIES IN RURAL AREAS AT
FIRST. THE TOTAL STOCK OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES STILL ONLY TOTALS 900,000 FOR A
POPULATION OF 17,000,000. A UNIVERSITY LIBRARY WAS FOUNDED IN DAR ES SALAAM IN
1961. AT PRESENT COMPLETE TRAINING FACILITIES FOR LIBRARY STAFF ARE NOT

LIBRARY ASSOCIATION EXISTS' TANZANIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND PUBLISHES A
JOURNAL CALLED 2MAKTABA1.
