LIBRARY SERVICE TO A COMMUNITY.
     
DISCUSSES AND SUGGESTS WAYS OF CATERING FOR THE READING NEEDS OF PEOPLE IN THE
AUTHOR'S BIRTHPLACE OF TOKAINO VILLAGE, BUIN, NORTH SOLOMONS PROVINCE, PAPUA
NEW GUINEA. ITS POPULATION IS 200, MOSTLY CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS, AND MOST
CHILDREN ATTEND THE 3 LOCAL COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. THERE IS NO LIBRARY SERVICE AT
PRESENT IN THE BUIN AREA, BUT THE BUIN PROVINCIAL HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVES
BOTH AS A SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARY. A PROPER PUBLIC LIBRARY SHOULD BE BUILT
IN THE TOWN CENTRE, RUN INDEPENDENTLY OF THE SCHOOL LIBRARY, AND COMMUNITY
INFORMATION CENTRES OR MOBILE SERVICES SHOULD OPERATE IN EACH AREA, THE FORMER
STAFFED BY A LIBRARIAN AND A TEACHER. SCHOOL DROPOUTS (THE AREA HAS MANY)
COULD COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARY
USE, WITH A VIEW TO POSSIBLE LIBRARY TRAINING FOR THOSE WHO WORK SUCCESSFULLY.
