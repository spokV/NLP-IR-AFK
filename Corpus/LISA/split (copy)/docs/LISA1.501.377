CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON CURRENT TRENDS IN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH.
CONTRASTS THE VISIBLE CRISIS OF UNIVERSAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS IN THE LAST
4-5 DECADES WITH THEIR SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT DURING 1876-1907. POINTS OUT
SOME SIGNS OF REVIVAL IN THE 1970S-THE APPEARANCE OF SEVERAL GENERAL
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS HAVING UP TO 3-4,000 HEADINGS. STRESSES THE NEED FOR
