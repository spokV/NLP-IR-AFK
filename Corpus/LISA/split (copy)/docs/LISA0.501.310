A VIEW FROM ZAMBIA.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION DEVOTED TO PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS FOR
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN ZAMBIA, ACQUISITIONS ARE CENTRALISED, WHICH CAN LEAD
TO UNSUITABLE SELECTION FOR LOCAL LIBRARIES. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY RECEIVES
MOST FUNDS, WHILE OTHER LIBRARIES SUFFER, AND THERE ARE FEW GOOD BOOKSHOPS.
INTERLENDING IS FOCUSED ON THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, AND ATTEMPTS TO
CREATE A NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE HAVE FAILED SO FAR. DEMAND FOR BOOKS IS
HIGH, BUT LIBRARIANS' STATUS IS LOW. INTERLENDING COULD BE BASED ON EXISTING
RESEARCH COLLECTIONS, BUT A CENTRAL COLLECTION OF JOURNALS WOULD BE COSTLY AND
PREMATURE.
