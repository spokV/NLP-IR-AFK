SURVEY OF THE PERIODICAL STOCK AT THE LIBRARY OF THE INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC
HEALTH.
     
THE GROWTH OF THE HUNGARIAN INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S OBJECTIVES AND
RESEARCH TEAM, THE LACK OF SPACE AND THE RISE IN JOURNAL PRICES INDUCED THE
LIBRARIANS TO EXAMINE THE USAGE OF JOURNALS. THEY WISHED TO ESTABLISH JOURNALS
WHICH NEED NOT BE SUBSCRIBED TO ANY LONGER; JOURNALS WHICH COULD BE PLACED IN
REMOTE STORAGE; AND JOURNALS WHICH READERS REGULARLY REQUIRE BUT WHICH ARE NOT
AVAILABLE IN THE LIBRARY. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 1 NOV 77 -30 APR 78. AS A
RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION IT CAN BE LAID DOWN THAT THE LIBRARY CAN COMPLY,
FROM ITS OWN STOCK, WITH A LARGE PART OF READERS' DEMANDS FOR JOURNALS. THE
SMALLER PART (29%) OF THE STOCK FULFILS 77% OF DEMANDS, THE LARGER PROPORTION
IS LITTLE USED. THE NUMBER OF JOURNALS NOT USED AT ALL IS SMALL. JOURNALS USED
LESS WILL BE PUT IN DISTANT STACKS; CURRENT JOURNALS AND OFTEN USED VOLUMES
WILL BE STORED IN THE LIBRARY.
