THE LIBRARY OF THE DE VOORST HYDRAULICS LABORATORY IN THE NOORDOOSTPOLDER IN
THE NETHERLANDS BEGAN WITH A SMALL COLLECTION OF DOCUMENTS IN 1963. BY 1980
THE LIBRARY CONTAINED OVER 20,000 DOCUMENTS, ANNUAL LOANS TOTALLED ALMOST
10,000 AND THE COLLECTION HAD LONG OUTGROWN THE ORIGINAL LIBRARY BUILDING. IN
1975 PLANS HAD ALREADY BEEN DRAWN UP FOR A NEW LIBRARY WITH A WORKING AREA OF
200 SQ.M. TOGETHER WITH A FURTHER 200 SQ.M. OF UNDERGROUND STORAGE AREA FOR
ARCHIVAL MATERIAL. THE PUBLIC, STAFF AND BOOKSTACK AREAS WERE PLANNED TO
PROVIDE THE MOST EFFICIENT LAYOUT FOR READERS AND STAFF AND REMOVAL OF THE
COLLECTION TO THE NEW LIBRARY WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED IN ADVANCE TO MINIMISE
DISRUPTION TO THE LIBRARY'S SERVICES.
