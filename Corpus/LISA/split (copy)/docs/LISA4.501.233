62% OF NORWEGIAN BRANCH LIBRARIES SERVE POPULATIONS UNDER 1000, 97% ARE
SMALLER THAN THE RECOMMENDED MINIMUM OF 100 SQ.M., AND 80% OPEN 6 HOURS OR
LESS PER WEEK. THERE IS NEED FOR A MASSIVE LIBRARY BUILDING PROGRAMME, OR,

18% OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHARE PREMISES WITH SCHOOL LIBRARIES, AND 20% WITH
OFFICES ETC. MULTI-PURPOSE PLANNING MUST RECOGNISE THE NEEDS OF ALL POTENTIAL
USERS AND INVOLVE THEM IN DISCUSSIONS. THE LIBRARY IS TRADITIONALLY USED FOR
ACTIVITIES SUCH AS MEETINGS AND CONCERTS. OTHER POSSIBILITIES INCLUDE
COOPERATION WITH NURSERY SCHOOLS, WHICH HAVE SHORT OPENING HOURS IN SPARSELY
POPULATED COMMUNITIES, OR WELFARE SERVICES, WHICH NEED CENTRAL PREMISES.
