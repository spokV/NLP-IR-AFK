UNPAID VOLUNTEERS AND PROFESSIONALS SIDE BY SIDE.
     
SINCE THE 2ND WORLD WAR THERE HAS BEEN A CLEAR TREND IN THE NETHERLANDS
TOWARDS PROFESSIONALISATION IN THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SERVICES. HOWEVER, IN
THE 1960S A REACTION CHARACTERISED BY THE GROWTH OF SELF-HELP ORGANISATIONS
TOOK PLACE AGAINST THE POST-WAR BUREAUCRATIC SOCIETY. WITH THE SUDDEN CHANGE
IN THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND THE RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE 1970S
PROFESSIONALS EMPLOYED IN THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SERVICES CAME TO RESENT THE
USE OF UNPAID VOLUNTEERS AS A THREAT TO THEIR OWN POSITIONS. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH
VOLUNTARY WORKERS IN LIBRARIES MAY LACK PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE THEY ARE OFTEN
MORE SOCIALLY-MOTIVATED THAN THEIR PROFESSIONAL COUNTERPARTS. VOLUNTARY
WORKERS IN LIBRARIES SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN DEMANDING AND USEFUL DUTIES BUT NOT
AT THE EXPENSE OF PAID LIBRARY STAFF.
