CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP-ITS ROLE IN LIBRARY CATALOGUING.

AN EXPLORATION OF PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY JUSTIFICATION
FOR THE TREATMENT OF CORPORATE BODIES AS AUTHORS REVEALS A HISTORY OF PARTIAL
ANSWERS AND INSUFFICIENTLY DETAILED ANALYSES BOTH OF CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP IN
PARTICULAR AND OF AUTHORSHIP IN GENERAL. THE REASON FOR THE FAILURES PROBABLY
RESTS IN THE FACT THAT AUTHORSHIP IS BOTH A COMPLEX PHENOMENON AND NECESSARILY
SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LIBRARY CATALOGUE THAT IT
IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED. PART I DEALS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF
CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP AND PART II WITH THE NATURE OF AUTHORSHIP IN GENERAL
UNDER THE HEADINGS' AUTHORSHIP BY ORIGINATION, AUTHORSHIP BY ASSUMPTION OF
RESPONSIBILITY, CORPORATE UTTERANCES AND CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP. IN CONCLUSION
RELATES CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP TO LIBRARY CATALOGUING.
