THE VETERINARY MEDICAL SECTION/MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION FOR LATIN AMERICA.
     
THE VETERINARY LIBRARIES, MEMBERS OF THE VMS/MLA, HAVE
INFORMATION/DOCUMENTATION SERVICES ORIENTED TOWARDS THE BIOMEDICAL FIELD. IN
SOUTH AMERICA, IT SEEMS THAT THIS INFORMATION IS ORIENTED TOWARD ANIMAL
INDUSTRY AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE NEEDS OF VETERINARY
USERS OR THE VETERINARY COLLECTIONS IN SOUTH AMERICAN LIBRARIES. THE
INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE VMS/MLA IS FROM THE WORK AND ACTIVITIES OF ITS
COMMITTEES. IN EACH INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY, ACCESS TO THE IMPORTANT DATA BASES,
E.G. CAB, BIOSIS, MEDLINE AND AGRICOLA, IS AVAILABLE. ACCESS TO THE CATALOGUE
OF EACH VETERINARY LIBRARY IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON MICROFILM OR IN A PRINTED
FORM.
