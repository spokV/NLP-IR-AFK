(PHD THESIS-FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY.) THE PATTERNS OF AND INTERRELATIONSHIPS
AMONG QUALITY, COLLABORATION, CITATIONS, AND SELF-CITATIONS OF CANCER RESEARCH
WERE INVESTIGATED USING SAMPLES OF PAPERS FROM 1974. THE COLLABORATIVE INDEX
(AVERAGE NUMBER OF AUTHORS PER PAPER) WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 2.98 (A HIGH
FIGURE). CANCER RESEARCH WAS FOUND TO BE HIGHLY CITED. AS QUALITY INCREASED,
SCATTER AMONG JOURNALS AND COUNTRIES DECREASED. QUANTITY AND QUALITY WITHIN A
GIVEN COUNTRY WERE HIGHLY CORRELATED. THE SELF-CITATION/TOTAL CITATION RATIO
DEPENDED ON QUALITY AND AGE OF THE PAPERS.
