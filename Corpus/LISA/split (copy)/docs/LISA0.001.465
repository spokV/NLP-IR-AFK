SURVIVING THE EIGHTIES: NEW ROLES FOR PUBLISHERS, INFORMATION SERVICE
ORGANIZATIONS, AND USERS.

(THE 1980 MILES CONRAD MEMORIAL LECTURE, PRESENTED AT THE 22ND NFAIS
CONFERENCE, 5 MAR 80.) NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL NOT SEE THE EXTINCTION OF
PUBLISHERS, INFORMATION SERVICE ORGANISATIONS AND USERS DURING THE 1980S, BUT
A CHANGE OF ROLES AND INTERRELATIONSHIPS. EXPLORES THIS THEME FOR EACH OF THE
GROUPS, AND CONTENDS THAT THE ECONOMY WILL BE HEALTHIER IN THE 80S, WITH
BETTER AND CHEAPER INFORMATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IF WE CAN FIND WAYS TO
TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE DIVERSITY, KNOW-HOW, CREATIVITY AND FINANCIAL
RESOURCES OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITHOUT IMPACTING ADVERSELY ON SERVICES, SUCH
AS PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THAT WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF
FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
