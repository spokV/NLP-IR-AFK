THE HANDICAPPED AND MUSIC: THE ROLE OF MUSIC LIBRARIES?.

THE DISABLED LIVING FOUNDATION HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH UK MUSIC LIBRARIES IN
RECENT YEARS TO PROVIDE AN ADVISORY SERVICE ON MUSIC FOR THE HANDICAPPED;
DANISH MUSIC LIBRARIES ARE ALSO ACTIVE IN THIS SPHERE. THE 60 MUSIC LIBRARIES
IN GERMANY HAVE SO FAR DONE LITTLE FOR THE HANDICAPPED; THEY SHOULD OBTAIN ALL
AVAILABLE INFORMATION FROM THE UK AND DISCUSS WITH LIBRARIANSHIP AND
GOVERNMENT BODIES THE ADAPTATION OF THE UK SCHEME FOR GERMANY. THE GERMAN
LIBRARY INSTITUTE COULD ORGANISE A PILOT PROJECT FOR 1983-84. TOPICS TO BE
CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE PROVISION OF MUSIC IN HOSPITALS, DAY CENTRES AND
SCHOOLS, THE USE OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS BY THE HANDICAPPED, THE PRODUCTION OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIES, THE IMPROVEMENT OF SPECIAL LIBRARY SERVICES AND EMPLOYMENT
POSSIBILITIES FOR THE HANDICAPPED IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.
