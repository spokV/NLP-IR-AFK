FACTOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SERVICE PROVIDED BY A LIBRARY.

DESCRIBES THE METHODS AND INFORMATION SOURCES USED BY THE STATE SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL LIBRARY OF LITHUANIAN SSR FOR PROVISION OF FACTOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
SERVICES. THE SOURCES OF FACTOGRAPHIC INFORMATION INCLUDE MAINLY TRADE
LITERATURE, STANDARDS AND PATENT DOCUMENTATION. BECAUSE NOT ALL FACTOGRAPHIC
ENQUIRIES CAN BE ANSWERED FROM SOURCES HELD BY THE LIBRARY, THE LIBRARY
COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR PATENT
INFORMATION AND TECHNICAL AND ECONOMICAL RESEARCH, WITH THE ALL-UNION
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR TECHNICAL INFORMATION, CLASSIFICATION AND
COORDINATION AND WITH A NUMBER OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES
IN THE USSR AND IN OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES.
