RESEARCH INTO THE READING HABITS OF SOVIET YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE 1920S.

WITH THE RECOGNITION TODAY OF THE SUPREME IMPORTANCE OF WORK WITH CHILDREN,
NEW ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO THE EARLY ATTEMPTS TO STUDY THE READING
BEHAVIOUR OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE 1920S. BOTH LENIN AND KRUPSKAYA STRESSED THE
NEED FOR SOVIET LIBRARIANS TO GET TO KNOW THE NEEDS AND THE BACKGROUNDS OF THE
PEOPLE THEY WERE TRYING TO SERVE, BUT EARLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH INTO YOUNG
PEOPLE'S READING TENDED TO BE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC THAN ACCURATE. IN LATER WORK
THE METHODOLOGY IMPROVED AND THE BASIS WAS LAID DOWN FOR MUCH OF TODAY'S
RESEARCH.
