THE BOOK OF THE FUTURE.

PART OF THE TEXT OF A PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION PAPER PREPARED BY UNESCO FOR THE
1982 WORLD CONGRESS OF BOOKS. MODERN TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING THE NATURE OF THE
BOOK AND ITS TRADITIONAL ROLE AS THE CHIEF MEANS OF TRANSMITTING KNOWLEDGE.
THE POSSIBILITIES RAISED BY MICROFORMS AND COMPUTERS ARE SURVEYED, IN RELATION
TO THE CONTRASTING SITUATIONS IN THE INDUSTRIALISED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS CREATED BY PAPER SHORTAGE, DESPITE INCREASED PRODUCTION
IN SOME AREAS, ARE EXAMINED, WITH STATISTICAL DATA SHOWING PRODUCTION AND
CONSUMPTION IN 1ST AND 3RD WORLD COUNTRIES. THE TENDENCY APPEARS NOW TO BE
TOWARDS 2 DIFFERENT KINDS OF BOOKS, 1 FOR THE ELITE AND THE OTHER FOR THE
MASSES. IN CONCLUSION THE NECESSITY FOR CONCERTED ACTION TO ENSURE THE FUTURE
OF THE BOOK IS URGED.
