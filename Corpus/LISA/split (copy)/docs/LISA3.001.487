FORMULATING A BIBLIOLOGICAL APPROACH.
     
A REPORT OF A FORUM HELD IN OCT 80 BY THE FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF
THE BOOK, SPONSORED BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, TO CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS
OF GENERAL USE OF TYPEWRITERS FOR TEACHING IN COMMERCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND FOR
INFORMATICS; AND THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CONSEQUENCES WORLDWIDE,
PRESENT AND FUTURE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF TYPEWRITERS FROM THEIR INVENTION UP TO
THE PRESENT IS TRACED, IN RELATION TO THE CONSEQUENCES IN THE ORGANISATION AND
ADMINISTRATION OF OFFICE WORK AND PERSONNEL DEPLOYMENT. THE INTRODUCTION OF
SOPHISTICATED MACHINES WHICH DISPENSE WITH TRADITIONAL OPERATORS IS CONSIDERED
AND THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR PUBLISHING METHODS AND INFORMATION
COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES SURVEYED. IN CONCLUSION, IT IS DEBATED WHETHER
BIBLIOLOGY MIGHT BECOME OUTMODED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AN APPENDIX LISTS THE
PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE FORUM.
