LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT A CONFERENCE ON READING MATERIALS FOR LIBRARY EDUCATION,
WEST BERLIN, 15-20 DEC 80. IN THE UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE AVERAGE CITIZEN
IS POOR AND ILLITERATE AND 90% OF THE POPULATION LIVES IN RURAL AREAS, WHERE
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION SERVICES ARE EXTREMELY LIMITED. IN MOST
UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE FINANCIAL BUDGET ALLOCATED TO LIBRARY STAFF AND
BOOKSTOCK IS EXTREMELY LIMITED. IN ADDITION, IN SOME COUNTRIES CONSIDERABLE
SUMS HAVE BEEN SPENT ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF CITY LIBRARIES TO U.K. AND U.S.A.
STANDARDS WITH A CONSEQUENT REDUCTION IN FUNDS FOR RURAL AREAS. THE AVAILABLE
RESOURCES SHOULD BE DIVIDED MORE EVENLY TO PROVIDE IMPROVED SERVICES
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
