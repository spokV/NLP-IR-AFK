LCS' AUTOMATED RESOURCE SHARING IN ILLINOIS.
     
THE LIBRARY COMPUTER SYSTEM (LCS) NETWORK IN ILLINOIS PROVIDES CIRCULATION
CONTROL FOR ITS MEMBER LIBRARIES. IN ADDITION, RESOURCE SHARING HAS BEEN
IMPLEMENTED BY ALLOWING EACH MEMBER LIBRARY TO SEARCH AND BORROW ITEMS FROM
THE COLLECTIONS OF THE OTHER MEMBERS. THE NETWORK IS COMPRISED OF THE 3
CAMPUSES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AND 14 OTHER ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN THE
STATE. THE COLLECTIVE LCS DATA BASE CONTAINS OVER 10 MILLION VOLUMES. EACH LCS
MEMBER LIBRARY CAN BETTER SERVE ITS PATRONS BECAUSE ITS ACCESS GOES BEYOND ITS
INDIVIDUAL COLLECTION TO THE ENTIRE LCS DATA BASE.
