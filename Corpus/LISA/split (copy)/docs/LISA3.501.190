GREAT DIFFERENCES IN THE FINANCIAL POSITION AND LEVEL OF SERVICES OF RESEARCH
LIBRARIES.
     
COMMENTS ON THE SECTIONS OF A REPORT BY THE RESEARCH PLANNING COUNCIL' 2THE
CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR1 WHICH DEAL WITH RESEARCH
LIBRARIES. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE REDUCTION OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR
ACQUISITION OF LITERATURE HAS LED TO SEVERE PROBLEMS FOR RESEARCH. ANALYSIS OF
THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1970S SHOWS INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE ON STAFF AND FALL
IN THE REAL VALUE OF THAT FOR ACQUISITIONS, TOGETHER WITH A DOUBLING OF
ISSUES. THE COMEMNTS ON LIBRARIES ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE REPORT, BUT CAN
BE CLASSED AS THOSE THAT MENTION' LIBRARIES WITHOUT PROBLEMS OF ACQUISITION,
OR LIBRARIES WHERE PROBLEMS HAVE NOT YET ARISEN, AND LIBRARIES WITH
CONSIDERABLE PROBLEMS. ARTS FACULTIES HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN SUBJECTS AND
FOREIGN SPECIALISED LITERATURE COINCIDING WITH A DECREASE IN BOOK GRANTS. IN
THE NATURAL SCIENCE FACULTIES, INSTITUTE LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ACQUIRE
BOOKS WHICH WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM A RESEARCH LIBRARY; GAPS
ARE APPEARING IN RUNS OF PERIODICALS, AND REFERENCE WORKS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY.
SERVICE LEVEL HAS GONE DOWN AS A RESULT OF UNDERMANNING OF LIBRARIES. SOME
LIBRARIES, FOR EXAMPLE THOSE OF THE AGRICULTURAL AND THE COMMERCIAL HIGH
SCHOOLS, STAND OUT AS PARTICULARLY HARD HIT.
