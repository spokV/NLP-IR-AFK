CLASSIFICATION OF HOMOSEXUALITY.
     
CRITICISES THE PLACING OF 'HOMOSEXUALITY' IN 2 CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS, DEWEY
(NORWEGIAN SUBJECT INDEX 1979) AND ARNESEN, THE NORWEGIAN VERSION OF DEWEY
(SUBJECT INDEX 1969). BOTH MAKE THE UNTENABLE ASSUMPTION THAT HOMOSEXUALITY IS
BY DEFINITION A SEXUAL DEVIATION. IN RECENT YEARS HOMOSEXUAL ORGANISATIONS
HAVE WON SOME SYMPATHY FOR THEIR VIEW OF HOMOSEXUALITY AS A WAY OF LIFE AS
VALID AS HETEROSEXUALITY, BUT THIS ASPECT IS NOT REPRESENTED IN THE TABLES.
EVEN THE MOST NEUTRAL PLACING, 301.45 MINORITIES, HAS OVERTONES OF INFERIORITY
AND DISCRIMINATION.
