PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORKING VIEWED FROM A STATE LIBRARY AGENCY.
     
ESPECIALLY OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS, US STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES HAVE PLAYED A
MAJOR ROLE IN THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF COOPERATIVE AND NETWORKING
ACTIVITIES AMONG PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND OTHER TYPES
OF LIBRARIES. THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN A GREAT VARIETY OF
WAYS, WITH EACH STATE REACTING TO ITS OWN DEMOGRAPHIC, GOVERNMENTAL, AND
LIBRARY REALITIES. THE FEDERAL LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT HAS BEEN
A MAJOR CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE ENABLING STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES TO BE EFFECTIVE
LEADERS IN COOPERATIVE AND NETWORKING ACTIVITIES. STATE LIBRARY AGENCIES AND
PUBLIC LIBRARIES WORKING TOGETHER CAN CONTINUE TO EXTEND LIBRARY SERVICES BY
TAKING LEADERSHIP IN NETWORKING ACTIVITIES.
