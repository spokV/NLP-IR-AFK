THE ARCHITECTS' COMPETITION FOR THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY LIBRARY.

GUTERSLOH PUBLIC LIBRARY WAS FOUNDED IN 1979 AS A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY BY
THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL AND THE FIRM OF BERTELSMANN. IN 1980, SINCE EXISTING
ACCOMMODATION WAS TOO SMALL, AN ARCHITECTS' COMPETITION WAS HELD TO DESIGN A
NEW LIBRARY BASED ON THE '3-TIER SYSTEM'. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE TOP 5
DESIGNS. THE WINNER HAS PLACED ON THE GROUND FLOOR A PASSAGE RUNNING RIGHT
THROUGH THE LIBRARY TO THE PARK BEYOND; OFF THIS PASSAGE IS THE '1ST TIER' OF
POPULAR FICTION AND NON-FICTION, ISSUE COUNTER AND READERS' CAFE WITH
NEWSPAPERS. THE 1ST AND 2ND FLOORS HOUSE MORE FICTION, NON-FICTION AND
PERIODICALS; THE 2ND FLOOR ALSO HOUSES STUDY CARRELS, MEDIA CENTRE, CONFERENCE
ROOM, STACK, ART CENTRE AND OFFICES. THE ADMINISTRATION SECTION IS ON THE 3RD
FLOOR AND THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY ON THE LOWER GROUND FLOOR.
