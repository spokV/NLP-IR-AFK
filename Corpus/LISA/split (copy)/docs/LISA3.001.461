OFFICE SYSTEMS AND PEOPLE.
     
OFFICES ARE ORGANISATIONAL UNITS IN WHICH INFORMATION IS PROCESSED BY PEOPLE.
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE ATTITUDES AND REQUIREMENTS OF THESE
PEOPLE BEFORE WE ATTEMPT TO DESIGN SYSTEMS FOR THEM. WE NEED MODELS OF OFFICES
AND OF OFFICE WORK, FOR USE AS A BASIS FOR SYSTEM DESIGN AND SYSTEM
EVALUATION. MODELS CAN BE DEVELOPED THROUGH STUDIES OF OFFICES AND IN
PARTICULAR THROUGH OBSERVATIONS OF HOW ELECTRONIC OFFICE SYSTEMS IMPACT OFFICE
WORK. SUMMARISES RECENT RESEARCH WORK IN THESE AREAS, AND SHOWS HOW IT CAN
ASSIST US IN DESIGNING SYSTEMS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF OFFICE WORKERS.
