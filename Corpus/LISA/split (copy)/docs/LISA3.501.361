IN THE IRON AGE OF CATALOGUING.
     
CUTTER DESCRIBED THE 19TH CENTURY HISTORY OF CATALOGUING AS THE GOLDEN AGE.
EXTENDS THIS METAPHOR TO THE 20TH CENTURY TO ELUCIDATE CURRENT TRENDS IN
CATALOGUING, ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVING THE USE OF THE COMPUTER. DOES THE
AUTOMATION OF THE CATALOGUE REPRESENT A TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE THAT WILL FREE
US FROM THE DIFFICULTIES OF MAIN ENTRY AND PROVIDE FOR CUTTER'S 2ND OBJECT?
ARGUES THAT THE CATALOGUING TRADITION OF PANIZZI, CUTTER, AND LUBETZKY WILL BE
EVEN MORE VALID, AND THAT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLES OF
CATALOGUING WILL BE REQUIRED IN THE FUTURE.
