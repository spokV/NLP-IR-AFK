HOSPITAL LIBRARY RESOURCES IN MASSACHUSETTS' DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS.
     
MASSACHUSETTS HOSPITALS WERE SURVEYED TO ESTABLISH SOME RANGES AND BASE LINE
STATISTICS FOR HOSPITAL MEDICAL INFORMATION RESOURCES. DATA WERE EVALUATED IN
TERMS OF THEORETICAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATION OF
HOSPITALS STANDARDS AS WELL AS THE MORE SPECIFIC PROPOSED APPENDICES TO THE
CANADIAN STANDARDS FOR HOSPITAL LIBRARIES. THE STUDY QUANTIFIES HOSPITAL
LIBRARY RESOURCES AND SERVICES IN A STATE WITH A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF ACUTE
CARE FACILITIES. 67.6% OF THOSE STUDIES WERE JUDGED AS MEETING EITHER THE
REVISED JCAH OR THE CANADIAN CRITERIA. THE CENTRAL FINDING IS THAT THE 100- TO
299-BED HOSPITALS REFLECT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES WHEN EVALUATED
AGAINST EITHER QUANTITATIVE OR NONQUANTITATIVE STANDARDS. SUGGESTS FURTHER
AREAS OF STUDY.
