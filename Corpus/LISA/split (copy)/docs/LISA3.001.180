A CHOICE BETWEEN QUALITY OR QUANTITY' THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE RECRUITMENT BAN
IN ENSCHEDE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
SINCE THE WORLD WAR II THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE IN THE NETHERLANDS HAS
UNDERGONE A PERIOD OF RAPID GROWTH. IN MANY TOWNS, NEW CENTRAL LIBRARIES AND
BRANCH LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN OPENED AND SPECIAL SERVICES HAVE BEEN INITIATED,
SUCH AS MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICES, RECORD LIBRARIES AND SERVICES TO FOREIGN
WORKERS AND OPEN SCHOOL STUDENTS. IN ADDITION, THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT PLANS TO
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARIES FROM 13 TO 19. HOWEVER,
ENSCHEDE PUBLIC LIBRARY, WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNATED A REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARY,
IS COMPELLED BY FINANCIAL CUTBACKS TO REDUCE ITS PRESENT STAFFING LEVELS BY
25%. AS A RESULT THE LIBRARY WILL BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT VOLUME OF
LOANS AND CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO LIMITING THE NUMBER OF BOOKS WHICH A
BORROWER MAY TAKE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND TO REFUSING TO ENROL NEW MEMBERS.
