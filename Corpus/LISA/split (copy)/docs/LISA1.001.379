PATTERNS IN THE USE OF OCLC BY ACADEMIC LIBRARY CATALOGING DEPARTMENTS.

A SURVEY OF THE CATALOGUING DEPARTMENTS OF 166 OCLC-MEMBER ACADEMIC LIBRARIES
SHOWED THAT LIBRARIES DID NOT RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON OCLC FOR CARD PRODUCTION AND
THAT A LARGE MAJORITY DID NOT ACCEPT NON-LIBRARY OF CONGRESS OCLC RECORDS
WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL CHECKING. THE SURVEY INDICATED ALSO THAT LIBRARIES THAT
USED OR PLANNED TO USE THEIR OCLC-MARC TAPES GENERALLY WERE MORE CONCERNED
WITH THE COMPLETENESS AND ACCURACY OF THEIR OCLC-MARC TAPE RECORDS THAN
LIBRARIES THAT DID NOT PLAN TO USE THEIR TAPES.
