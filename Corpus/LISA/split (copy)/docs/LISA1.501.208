PROBLEMS IN COLLECTING SOCIAL DATA' A REVIEW FOR THE INFORMATION RESEARCHER.
     
DISCUSSES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WHICH THE INFORMATION SCIENTIST FACES WHEN

ACTUAL SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH DATA ARE COLLECTED.
QUALITATIVE METHODS MAY ALSO BE BIASED BY SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTRAINS
INHERENT IN THEIR USE. THIS IS ILLUSTRATED BY REVIEWING THE CASE OF THE
RESEARCH INTERVIEW. 2 POSSIBILITIES ARE OUTLINED WHICH HELP TO INCREASE THE
ADEQUACY OF DATA COLLECTION.
