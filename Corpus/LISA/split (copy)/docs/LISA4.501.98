THE PROPORTION OF READERS IN THE ELDERLY POPULATION OF QUEBEC AND OF CANADA.
     
PRESENTS STATISTICAL DATA COMPARING QUEBEC WITH CANADA AS A WHOLE, ON THE
PROPORTION OF READERS IN THE ADULT POPULATION; AND ON THE PROPORTION OF
READERS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF MATERIAL IN THE ELDERLY (OVER 65) POPULATION. THE
POSITION OF THE ELDERLY POPULATION IS THEN COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE TOTAL
ADULT POPULATION, AND IN CONCLUSION DISCUSSES THE PROBABILITY THAT THE NUMBER
OF ELDERLY READERS, AND PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS, WILL INCREASE, NECESSITATING
EXPANSION OF LIBRARY FACILITIES TO MEET THEIR DEMANDS.
