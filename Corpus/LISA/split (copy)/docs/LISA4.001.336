NETWORK SERVICE CENTERS AND THEIR EXPANDING ROLE.
     
THE GROWTH OF OCLC AS AN AUTOMATED LIBRARY RESOURCE-SHARING SYSTEM HAS BEEN
MADE POSSIBLE IN PART BY INTERMEDIARY ORGANISATIONS, OR NETWORKS, THAT
FUNCTION AS MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTING AGENTS FOR OCLC SERVICES. AS THEY HAVE
GROWN, THE NETWORKS HAVE TAKEN ON OTHER ROLES. THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF THE
DIRECTORS OF THE NETWORKS REVEAL PATTERNS OF SERVICE BEYOND OCLC, AND INDICATE
THAT THE NETWORKS PROVIDE, OR PLAN TO PROVIDE, AUTOMATED LIBRARY SUPPORT
SYSTEMS THEMSELVES. SURVEY RESULTS ALSO REVEAL BROKERAGE OF OTHER AUTOMATED
SERVICES, NETWORKS' REVENUE SOURCES, STAFF SIZE AND GROWTH, AND FUTURE PLANS.
