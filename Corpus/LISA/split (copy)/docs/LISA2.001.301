LIBRARY USER EDUCATION (IN GERMAN)
     
.FROM 5-9 SEPT 79 LOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, HELD A CONFERENCE IN
CAMBRIDGE ON 'LIBRARY USER EDUCATION-ARE NEW APPROACHES NEEDED?' IT WAS OF
GREAT INTEREST TO THE VISITORS FROM WEST GERMANY AS THEY WERE ABLE TO GAIN
FIRST HAND IMPRESSIONS OF PROBLEMS AND EXPERIENCES IN LIBRARY USER EDUCATION
IN THE USA AND THE UK. LIBRARY USER EDUCATION HAS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD FOR
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS BUT NEEDS TO BE STANDARDISED. IT WAS FELT THAT THE
ACADEMIC LEVEL OF LIBRARY USER EDUCATION SHOULD BE RAISED AND THAT ITS
ACHIEVEMENTS WERE NOT YET FULLY RECOGNISED. THE FORM OF LIBRARY USER EDUCATION
PRACTISED IN LIBRARIES IN THE UK CANNOT BE DIRECTLY ADOPTED BY UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES IN WEST GERMANY OWING TO DIFFERENT CONDITIONS IN AREAS SUCH AS
LIBRARIAN TRAINING.
