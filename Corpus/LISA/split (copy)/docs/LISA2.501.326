FILM-SHOWS AND LIBRARIES.
     
FOLLOWING A REQUEST BY HORDALAND COUNTY LIBRARY, DELEGATES FROM THE NORWEGIAN
STATE FILM CENTRE, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL CINEMATOGRAPHERS, AND
THE STATE LIBRARY OFFICE DISCUSSED FILM-SHOWS AS PART OF LIBRARY SERVICE.
LIBRARIES, LIKE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND CULTURAL COMMITTEES, CAN OBTAIN
PERMISSION FOR FILM-SHOWS, CERTAIN SHORT OR INFORMATIONAL FILMS BEING EXEMPT.
COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARY AND AUTHORITY MAY INCLUDE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION,
JOINT SHOWS FOR PRESCHOOL CHILDREN, USE OF FILM IN FURTHER EDUCATION, AND
SHOWING OF FILMS AND VIDEOTAPES IN LIBRARIES. GOOD CHILDREN'S FILMS ARE IDEAL
FOR LIBRARY SHOWING AND CAN BE LINKED WITH BOOKS. NOT ALL LIBRARY PREMISES ARE
SUITABLE FOR FILM-SHOWS; THIS FACTOR SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN PLANNING NEW
LIBRARIES. LOAN OF FILMS SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY COUNTY LIBRARIES. ALL
LIBRARIES SHOULD HAVE FILM CATALOGUES, POSSIBLY DISTRIBUTED BY THE STATE
LIBRARY OFFICE. THE ASSOCIATION OF CINEMATOGRAPHERS HOPE TO PURCHASE SEVERAL
SETS OF APPARATUS FOR USE IN SELECTED AREAS.
