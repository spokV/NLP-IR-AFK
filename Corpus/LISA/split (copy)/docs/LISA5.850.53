PEOPLE SHOULD BROADEN THEIR OUTLOOK: SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE 'NARROW'
CATCHWORD.

LIBRARIANS STILL COPE BADLY WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE NARROW CATCHWORD BECAUSE
THEIR TERMINOLOGICAL CONTROL IS STILL INEFFECTIVE. THE NARROW CATCHWORD USES
PRECISE TERMINOLOGY AND SEPARATES RELATED MATERIAL; THE BROAD CATCHWORD COVERS
WIDE SUBJECT AREAS AND TENDS TO RESULT IN THE FORMATION OF HIERARCHIES OF
SUBORDINATED GROUPS. DIE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEK (GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY) USES
MAINLY NARROW CATCHWORDS, EQUATING THIS WITH PRECISE SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION
BUT OCCASIONALLY DEVIATIONS FROM THIS PRINCIPLE OCCUR. CATCHWORDS IN SOME
SUBJECT AREAS ARE NARROWER THAN IN OTHERS. TERMINOLOGY IS CAREFULLY CONTROLLED
AND THIS IS ESSENTIAL WHEN PRECISE TERMS ARE USED. IF PRECISE SUBJECT
DEFINITION AND STRICT TERMINOLOGY CONTROL ARE CLOSELY LINKED THEN IT FOLLOWS
THAT PRECISE SUBJECT DEFINITION CAN ONLY BE CARRIED OUT IN THE USER'S INTEREST
WHEN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF WELL-TRAINED STAFF ARE AVAILABLE.
