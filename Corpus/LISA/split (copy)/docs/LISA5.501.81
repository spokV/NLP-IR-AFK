SCOTLAND WITH NO 1 AUTHORITY ADHERING RIGIDLY TO ANY STANDARD. WHERE AND WHEN
A MOBILE STOPS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN ITS USE. AS MOST VISITS ARE ON
WEEKDAYS BETWEEN 9.00 AM AND 5.00 PM, MORE WOMEN THAN MEN USE THE SERVICE.
MOST USERS LIVE WITHIN 1/4 OF A MILE OF A STOPPING POINT. THE SERVICE IS
GREATLY VALUED BY USERS VALUED BY USERS ALTHOUGH IT IS GENERALLY INFERIOR TO A
