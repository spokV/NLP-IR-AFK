THE ELGIN COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
THE ELGIN COUNTY (ONTARIO) LIBRARY ASSOCIATION WAS FOUNDED IN 1936; IT WAS A
COOPERATIVE VENTURE AND BY 1964 IT HAD 12 MEMBER LIBRARIES. THESE WERE
INDEPENDENT LIBRARIES AND MOST HAD SOMEWHAT PRECARIOUS FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM
THE COUNTY COUNCIL, LOCAL COUNCIL, AND INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND
ORGANISATIONS. IN 1964, A FULLY TAX SUPPORTED COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY WAS
SUGGESTED TO REPLACE THE ASSOCIATION. THIS WAS AGREED AND THE NEW SYSTEM WAS
FOUNDED IN 1966. BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE SYSTEM'S DEVELOPMENT TO DATE,
FINANCING, AND PLANS FOR THE FUTURE.
