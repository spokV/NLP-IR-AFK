PATTERNS OF JOURNAL USE IN A DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY' A CITATION ANALYSIS.

CITATION ANALYSIS OF FACULTY PUBLICATIONS, DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS, AND
PRELIMINARY DOCTORAL QUALIFYING BRIEFS PRODUCED BY FACULTY AND STUDENTS OF THE
BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, TEMPLE UNIVERSITY, IS USED TO ASSESS JOURNAL USE IN THE
BIOLOGY LIBRARY DURING THE YEARS 1975-77. THERE ARE 3,739 CITATIONS TO 336
JOURNALS IN THE COMBINED SOURCES RANKING. THE DISTRIBUTION OF CITATIONS IN
EACH USER GROUP RANKING AND THE COMBINED SOURCES RANKING TAKES THE FORM OF A
BRADFORD DISTRIBUTION. 60 HIGHLY CITED TITLES ARE EXAMINED IN DETAIL.
DISSERTATION CITATIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON ACTIVE FACULTY PARTICIPATION IN THE
DOCTORAL PROGRAMME. CITATIONS IN QUALIFYING BRIEFS COVER A BROADER RANGE OF
TOPICS AND INTERESTS THAN EITHER OF THE OTHER 2 SOURCES. CITATION FREQUENCIES
OF VOLUMES PUBLISHED IN THE PERIODS 1960-69 AND 1970-77 ARE EXAMINED. SEVERAL
COLLECTION MAINTENANCE AND DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE, BASED ON THE
RESULTS OF THIS STUDY. CITATION ANALYSIS IS SHOWN TO BE A USEFUL TOOL IN
ASSESSING ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL JOURNAL USE BY A HETEROGENEOUS CLIENTELE IN A
DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY.
