THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN TANZANIA.
     
FOLLOWING INDEPENDENCE IN 1961 THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FORMER BRITISH COLONY OF
TANZANIA HAS PLACED A HIGH PRIORITY ON THE PROVISION OF EDUCATION FOR ALL
LEVELS OF THE POPULATION. AS PART OF THIS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME FUNDS HAVE
BEEN ALLOCATED IN THE NATIONAL BUDGET FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES.
IN 1963 THE GOVERNMENT FOUNDED THE TANGANYIKA LIBRARY SERVICES BOARD WHICH WAS
REPLACED IN 1975 BY THE TANZANIA LIBRARY SERVICES BOARD. THE BOARD'S FUNCTIONS
INCLUDE THE SUPERVISION OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES, THE TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS
AND THE PUBLICATION OF THE TANZANIA NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF
THE LACK OF ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND OF TRAINED LIBRARIANS THE BOARD
HAS BEEN UNABLE TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES OF PROVIDING AT LEAST 1 PUBLIC
LIBRARY IN EACH REGION OF THE COUNTRY.
