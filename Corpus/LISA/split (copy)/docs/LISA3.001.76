LIBERALISM INCARNATE AND MEDIOCRITY ON THE RAILS.
     
INTERVIEWS THE AUTHOR, PER HOJHOLT, WHO ARGUES THAT LIBRARIES COULD SUPPORT
QUALITY LITERATURE MORE EFFECTIVELY BY ORDERING MORE COPIES OF GOOD BOOKS.
INSTEAD LIBRARIES, GIVING IN TO POPULAR DEMAND, CONTAIN A SURFEIT OF MEDIOCRE
AUTHORS. LOCAL FREEDOM TO SELECT IS LARGELY AN ILLUSION AS IN PRACTICE THE
BINDING CENTRE'S REVIEWS ARE HEAVILY RELIED UPON. THE POPULARITY OF
SOCIOLOGICAL AND WOMEN'S NOVELS SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED ENTIRELY, HOWEVER, AS
LIBRARIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CATER BOTH FOR QUALITY AND TOPICALITY. AUTHORS
OF SCHOOL AND CHILDREN'S BOOKS, ON THE ONE HAND, AND OF ADULT BOOKS, ON THE
OTHER, SHOULD HAVE THEIR LIBRARY FEES ASSESSED SEPARATELY. THE WORK OF
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS IS EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL AND THEIR TRAINING SHOULD
REFLECT THIS; LITERARY QUALITY HARDLY APPLIES TO CHILDREN'S LITERATURE.
SUGGESTS SALE OF BOOKS IN LIBRARIES TO ENSURE THE SURVIVAL OF THE BOOK TRADE.
