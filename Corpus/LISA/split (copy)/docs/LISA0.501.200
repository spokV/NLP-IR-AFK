IN SERVICE TRAINING COURSES FOR VOLUNTARY WORKERS.

IN EASTERN SLOVAKIA FROM A TOTAL OF MORE THAN 1,100 PUBLIC LIBRARIES, ABOUT
950 ARE STAFFED BY PART-TIME LIBRARIANS. THEY WORK ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS MAINLY
IN THE VILLAGES. ON AVERAGE 50% ARE TEACHERS FROM LOCAL SCHOOLS. IN SPITE OF
THEIR DEDICATION AND HARD WORK, THE VOLUNTEERS OFTEN LACKED THE NECESSARY
KNOWLEDGE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. FOR THAT REASON,
REGULATIONS, ISSUED BY THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF CULTURE IN 1976, IMPOSED THE
DUTY ON DISTRICT LIBRARIES TO MAKE PROVISIONS FOR IN-SERVICE TRAINING OF THE
SAID LIBRARIANS, RANGING FROM 8 TO 24 HOURS PER YEAR. SO FAR, THE SYLLABUSES
OF SUCH SHORT COURSES AS WELL AS TEACHING METHODS HAVE VARIED CONSIDERABLY. IN
ADDITION TO THE TRADITIONAL LECTURES, DISCUSSIONS AND ROLE PLAYING, FOR
INSTANCE, ARE TO BE USED MORE WIDELY. MORE PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH SLOVAK
AND FOREIGN LITERATURE (BELLES-LETTRES, FICTION) AND ALSO A GREATER INSIGHT
INTO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ADULTS WILL NO DOUBT,  EXERCISE FAVOURABLE INFLUENCE ON
THE LIBRARIAN'S PERFORMANCE, WHICH, IN TURN, WILL RESULT IN EXPANSION OF THE
LOCAL LIBRARY AND ITS SERVICES.
