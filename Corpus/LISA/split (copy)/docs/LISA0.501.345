SAP-A NEW WAY TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS.

WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SUBJECT ACCESS PROJECT (SAP), AT LUND UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY, SWEDEN, A NEW VERSION OF ON-LINE CATALOGUE FOR MONOGRAPHS HAS BEEN
DEVELOPED. USING THE SAP-INDEXING METHOD, EXISTING BIBLIOGRAPHIC CATALOGUE
RECORDS HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITH SELECTED TERMS FROM CONTENTS TABLES AND BOOK
INDEXES. THE IDEA OF SAP IS TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS OF BOOKS TAKEN
FROM THE BOOKS THEMSELVES AND TO MAKE MORE USE OF A PUBLICATION'S 'INHERENT'
ATTRIBUTES. IT IS ALSO AN APPROACH TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF CLASSIFICATION
SYSTEMS IN DESCRIBING A BOOK'S CONTENTS BY MEANS OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF
CLASSIFICATION CODES. BY SAP, LOW COST RETRIEVAL CAPABILITIES ARE PROVIDED FOR
MONOGRAPH USERS.
