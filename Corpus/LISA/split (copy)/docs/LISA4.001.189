STANDARDS, SPECIFICATIONS, AND CODES' A UNION LIST APPROACH TO RESOURCE
SHARING IN THE CHICAGO METROPOLITAN AREA.
     
AS A RESULT OF MORE SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY AND A GROWING CONSUMER PRESSURE
FOR PRODUCT RELIABILITY, MANUFACTURERS, ENGINEERS, GOVERNMENTAL
REPRESENTATIVES, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC ALIKE ARE REQUIRING IMPROVED ACCESS TO
STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS. TRADITIONALLY, THIS INFORMATION RESOURCE HAS
BEEN DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY, TO CONTROL, AND TO SERVICE. AS A RESPONSE TO THIS
PROBLEM, A SMALL TASK FORCE OF CHICAGO AREA TECHNICAL LIBRARIANS CONDUCTED A
SURVEY OF AREA USERS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT STANDARDS COLLECTIONS WERE AVAILABLE,
WHAT THE LEVEL OF NEED FOR STANDARDS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE, AND THE EXTENT TO
WHICH EXISTING COLLECTIONS MIGHT BE SHARED AMONG USERS.
