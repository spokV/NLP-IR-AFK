ISSUE CONTROL ON A WRONG TRACK.
     
A CRITICAL REVIEW BY VEJLE LIBRARY'S AUTOMATION COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES' REPORT ON 2AUTOMATED ISSUE CONTROL, 1ONE OF
THE PROPOSALS FOR STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS ISSUED BY THE BIBLIOTEKSDATA
PARTNERS. THE REVIEW POINTS TO PROBLEMS OF USE OF THE REGISTER OF PERSONAL
CODE NUMBERS. THE SYSTEM WHEREBY CHECK-OUT USES PERSONAL NUMBERS, WHILE THE
RETURN PROCESS USES BOOK NUMBERS, CAUSES PROBLEMS FOR THE READER OF
IDENTIFYING WHICH BOOKS ARE DUE BACK WHEN. DISCUSSES HOW THE SYSTEM DEALS WITH
RENEWALS, FINES, AND RECALLS. USE OF BOOK NUMBERS ONLY FOR RESERVATIONS
AMOUNTS TO A DETERIORATION OF SERVICE, AND THE METHOD WHEREBY INTERLIBRARY
LOANS ARE INCLUDED IS UNCLEAR. ISSUE CONTROL OVER MATERIAL WHICH CANNOT BE
GIVEN A BOOK NUMBER (E.G. PICTURE BOOKS, JIGSAWS) IS EFFECTIVELY ABANDONED. IN
ALL, THE LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT EACH LOAN CAUSES MAJOR PROBLEMS; IT SHOULD
BE POSSIBLE TO USE THE INFORMATION IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC BASE ALSO IN THE
ISSUE CONTROL REGISTERS.
