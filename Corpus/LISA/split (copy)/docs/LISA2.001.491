BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY JOURNAL PRICES.
     
A STUDY OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY JOURNAL PRICES FOR 1967-79 IS
PRESENTED. RESULTS SHOW THAT THESE JOURNALS ARE COMPARABLE IN COST TO PHYSICS
AND CHEMISTRY JOURNALS, PREVIOUSLY FOUND MOST COSTLY. WHEN WEIGHTED AVERAGES
ARE COMPARED, THESE JOURNALS ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE FOR WHICH PRICE DATA ARE
AVAILABLE IN THE USA. A SMALL NUMBER OF HIGHLY CITED JOURNALS ACCOUNT FOR
NEARLY 50% OF THE COST OF THE ENTIRE LIST OF 83 JOURNALS STUDIED-A FACT WHICH
HAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF JOURNAL COLLECTIONS. THE NEED
FOR GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO ACADEMIC LIBRARIES FOR THE PURCHASE OF SCIENTIFIC
JOURNALS IS REITERATED.
