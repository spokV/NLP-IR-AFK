LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
     
REPORT ON THE IFLA/UNESCO SEMINAR FOR LIBRARIANS FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ON
LIBRARY WORK FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE, LEIPZIG, AUG 81. THE BASIC THEME
WAS DISCUSSED WITH REFERENCE TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN
AMERICA, WHERE MANY CHILDREN ATTEND SCHOOL ONLY BRIEFLY OR NOT AT ALL, SO THEY
REMAIN ILLITERATE. MANY PARENTS ARE ALSO ILLITERATE SO READING IN LEISURE
HOURS IS NOT ENCOURAGED. WHAT SCHOOL BOOKS AND LESSONS THERE ARE EXIST ONLY IN
AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, GENERALLY THAT OF A COLONISING POWER. THERE IS A LACK OF
PUBLISHED MATERIAL IN LOCAL LANGUAGES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE NEVER EVEN BEEN
WRITTEN DOWN. IN THESE COUNTRIES A LIBRARY NETWORK MUST BE ESTABLISHED AND THE
GROWTH OF READING ENCOURAGED WITH THE HELP OF PROFESSIONAL AND VOLUNTARY
STAFF. LIBRARY SERVICE FOR THE HANDICAPPED POSE SPECIAL PROBLEMS.
