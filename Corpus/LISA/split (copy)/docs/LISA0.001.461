GILDING A GOLDEN GLOW.

HISTORICAL REVIEW AND DETAILS OF CURRENT PRACTICE IN THE ART OF EDGE GILDING,
BASED ON THE AUTHOR'S PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, WITH SECTIONS ON PREPARATION FOR
GILDING, GOLD LEAVES, GLAIRE, BURNISHING, AND MECHANISED GILDING.
MECHANISATION HAS MEANT THAT GILDING BOOKS IS NOW MORE WIDESPREAD THAN EVER,
ALTHOUGH HAND CRAFTING STILL REMAINS A CHALLENGE, AND THE FINISHED PRODUCT IS
STILL APPRECIATED BY THE BIBLIOPHILE.
