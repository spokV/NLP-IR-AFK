INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUES-A SPECIALISED INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.
     
COLLABORATION OF THE COMECON COUNTRIES HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO THE FIELD OF
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION. SINCE 1973, A SPECIALISED SECTION
DEALING WITH INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUES HAS BEEN IN OPERATION. IN ADDITION TO
CATALOGUES, THE COLLECTIONS INCLUDE PRESPECTUSES, TECHNICAL INFORMATION
LEAFLETS, TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS, PRICELISTS, PRODUCTION PROGRAMMES, WORKS
BULLETINS, COMPANY REPORTS AND THE LIKE. THE COLLECTIONS ARE NOT ONLY A SOURCE
OF INVALUABLE INFORMATION ON NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT ARE REFERRED TO, FOR EXAMPLE,
WHENEVER NEW PRODUCTS ARE PLANNED AND DESIGNED. THE SECTION IS HEADED BY THE
STATE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARY OF THE USSR, WHERE THE BULLETIN 2NEW
INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUES1, CONTAINING 19 SERIES, IS PUBLISHED TWICE A MONTH. ITS
INDUSTRIAL CATALOGUES' COLLECTION IS MADE UP OF 100,000 ITEMS. IN BULGARIA,
THE RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS RESPECT IS WITH THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL LIBRARY. DURING THE YEARS 1976-80 COMPUTERISATION OF THE SYSTEM HAS
BEEN IN PROGRESS, AND A LONGTERM PLAN UP TO 1990 HAS BEEN WORKED OUT.
