INFORMATION AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE WORK AT A NEW LEVEL IN CENTRALISED
SYSTEMS.

CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS HAVE RESPONDED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS TO THE CALL
FOR GREATER DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION WORK. EXAMPLES FROM ALL OVER THE USSR
SHOW HOW THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN MORE BOOK PROMOTION AND INFORMATION
DISSEMINATION; ORGANISED SURVEYS TO ASCERTAIN THE INFORMATION NEEDS IN THEIR
AREA; PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS; AND
ESTABLISHED IMPORTANT LINKS WITH THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION
CENTRES AT REPUBLICAN LEVEL. PUBLIC LIBRARIES, MINDFUL OF THEIR ROLE TO SERVE
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY, ARE ALSO TURNING THEIR ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF
POLITICAL WORKERS, TEACHERS AND OTHERS OUTSIDE THE SPHERE OF MATERIAL
PRODUCTION.
