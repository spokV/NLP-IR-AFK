WAKE UP, HOLGER DANSKE (AND LISE OSTERGAARD).
     
DISCUSSES THE PRODUCTION OF A DANISH ENCYCLOPAEDIA. THE PUBLISHERS, GYLDENDAL,
HOPED TO PRODUCE AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE ESTEEMED SALMONSEN, BUT THE PROJECT
PROVED TOO EXPENSIVE AND A LESS AMBITIOUS 10 VOLUME WORK HAS NOW BEEN
PUBLISHED. A SIMILAR LACK OF A SUBSTANTIAL NATIONAL ENCYCLOPAEDIA LED IN
SWEDEN TO THE APPOINTMENT OF A COMMITTEE BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, WHOSE
REPORT IS DISCUSSED HERE. IT ANALYSES ALL PROBLEMS SURROUNDING THE PUBLICATION
OF ENCYCLOPAEDIAS AND CONCLUDES THAT SUCH PUBLICATION CAN TODAY ONLY BY
UNDERTAKEN WITH STATE SUPPORT. IT STRESSES THE NEED FOR A LARGE ENCYCLOPAEDIA
FOR THE ACQUISITION OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION. USE WILL BE MAINLY IN
CONNECTION WITH EDUCATION, IN ADMINISTRATION AND INDUSTRY, AND WILL BE CENTRAL
IN LIBRARY REFERENCE SECTIONS. GUIDELINES FOR THE COOPERATION BETWEEN
PUBLISHERS AND THE STATE ARE DRAWN UP, AND A PUBLISHING TIMETABLE OF AT MOST
10 YEARS WITH UPDATING EVERY 10 YEARS IS SUGGESTED. PUB LICATION AS TELEDATA
OR ON VIDEO DISCS IS REJECTED.
