THEORETICAL APPROACHES TO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.

PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF RESEARCH CONDUCTED DURING A VISITING FELLOWSHIP, MAR
80-MAR 81, ON THE FOLLOWING TOPICS' RETRIEVAL METHODS OF DOCUMENTS INDEXED BY
WEIGHTED INDEX TERMS; SIMILARITY MEASURES FOR BOOLEAN SEARCH REQUEST
FORMULATIONS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS; DOCUMENT-CLUSTERING-BASED INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL AND DOCUMENT CLUSTERING UTILISING PREVIOUSLY FORMED QUERY CLUSTERS;
AND A PROBABILISTIC APPROACH TO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN SYSTEMS WITH BOOLEAN
SEARCH REQUEST FORMULATIONS. A NUMBER OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES
APPLICABLE IN SYSTEMS BASED ON BOOLEAN SEARCHES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. SPECIAL
ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO INCORPORATE INTO THE STANDARD BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL
SCHEMES A WEIGHTING MECHANISM TO PRODUCE RANKED LISTS OF DOCUMENTS. SEVERAL
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES HAVE BEEN OFFERED WHICH ARE BASED ON RESULTS OF FUZZY
SET THEORY AND FUZZY LOGIC, PROBABILITY THEORY AND DECISION ANALYSIS, AND THE
THEORY OF BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS.
