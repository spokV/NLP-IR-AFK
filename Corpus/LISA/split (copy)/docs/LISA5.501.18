ALA' CLA TIES THAT BIND, BUT DON'T CHAFE.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PAPERS PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION ANNUAL CONFERENCE, JUNE 81. EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE CANADIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, AND PLACES
IT IN ITS HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. NOTES THE UNPARALLELED GROWTH OF AMERICAN
AND CANADIAN LIBRARIES IN THE 1960S, AND IDENTIFIES THE CHALLENGES WHICH THEY
FACE IN THE 1980S. LIBRARIES IN BOTH COUNTRIES ARE SEEN AS HAVING TO DEAL WITH
THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY INCREASED COSTS FOR LABOUR AND LIBRARY MATERIALS,
COUPLED WITH AN ALL OVER DECLINE IN FUNDING, AND COMPETITION FROM NEW
INFORMATION AGENCIES, FROM SUPERMARKETS AND OTHER OUTLETS FOR COMMERCIAL
READING, AND FROM VIEWING AND LISTENING MATERIALS. DISCUSSES THE LINK BETWEEN
US AND CANADIAN LIBRARY EDUCATION, AND INDICATES THE POSSIBLE NEED FOR A
CHANGE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.
