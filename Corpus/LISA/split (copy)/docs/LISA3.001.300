UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS IN HUNGARIAN LIBRARIES.
     
HUNGARIAN LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN ORGANISED IN NETWORKS SINCE THE 1950S AND MORE
RECENTLY THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS TO COORDINATE ACQUISITIONS. THE HIGH COST OF
FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS IS A PROBLEM. GENEROUS LEGAL DEPOSIT LAWS COMPENSATE TO
SOME EXTENT FOR UNION CATALOGUE INADEQUACIES. THE NATIONAL SZECHENYI LIBRARY
DOES NOT LEND MATERIAL, BUT ACTS AS A SWITCHING CENTRE. NEW REGULATIONS WILL
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LIBRARIES LENDING MATERIAL. 23% OF REQUESTS ARE
SATISFIED ABROAD. DEMAND IS AT A RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL, BUT SHOWS A STEADY
GROWTH. 2 NEW BODIES, THE CENTRAL STORAGE LIBRARY AND THE CENTRAL REGISTER OF
LIBRARIES, WILL BRING SOME IMPROVEMENTS.
