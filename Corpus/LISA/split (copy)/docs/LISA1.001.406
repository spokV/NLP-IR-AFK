ANALYSIS AND CODING OF GENERIC CHEMICAL FORMULAE IN CHEMICAL PATENTS.

PRESENTS A FORMAL LINGUISTIC APPROACH TO THE REPRESENTATION OF GENERIC
CHEMICAL FORMULAE IN CHEMICAL PATENTS, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF USE OF THE ALWIN
LINE-FORMULA NOTATION (AN ALGORITHMIC VERSION OF THE WISWESSER LINE NOTATION).
THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REPRESENTATION IS TO PERMIT SEARCHES FOR SPECIFIC
STRUCTURES AND FOR SUBSTRUCTURES WHICH ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE GENERIC
EXPRESSION. THE RELEVANCE OF PATTERN ANALYSIS METHODS TO THIS PROBLEM IS
HIGHLIGHTED AND PRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS ON ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT ARE PUT
FORWARD.
