BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS FOR MICROFORM COLLECTIONS.
     
BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL TITLES IN MICROFORM COLLECTIONS IS A
PROBLEM. NEITHER THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS NOR MOST MICROPUBLISHERS FULLY
ANALYSE THESE COLLECTIONS. INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES CANNOT AFFORD TO DO SO EITHER.
BUT WITHOUT AUTHOR AND TITLE ACCESS, THESE COLLECTIONS ARE NOT VERY USEFUL.
FULL ANALYTICS FOR MICROFORM COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN CALLED FOR BUT NO EFFORT
YET HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIES ABANDON FULL CATALOGUING IN
FAVOUR OF INDEXING, USING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY MICROPUBLISHERS. WHILE A
NATIONAL INDEX TO THE CONTENTS OF MICROFORM COLLECTIONS WOULD BE BEST, AN
ALTERNATIVE FOR LOCAL LIBRARIES WOULD BE TO CREATE THEIR OWN COM INDEX.
