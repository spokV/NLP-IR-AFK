THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL EIGHTIES.
     
THE HISTORY OF COMPUTERISATION IN THE EAST LONDON PUBLIC LIBRARY (SOUTH
AFRICA) IS OUTLINED. AN EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT STATUS SHOWS THAT THE SYSTEM
IS DATED IN RELATION TO NEW TECHNOLOGY. A CHANGE TO AN ON-LINE SYSTEM IS
FORESEEN. SINCE AACR2 AND SAMARC WERE NOT IN EXISTENCE AT THE TIME OF INITIAL
COMPUTERISATION, THE PRESENT SYSTEM IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THEM-A FACTOR THAT
WILL AFFECT COOPERATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES IN A POSSIBLE FUTURE NETWORK. THE
POSSIBLE USE IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES OF COMPUTERS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCES, SUCH AS READING AIDS FOR THE BLIND, IS DISCUSSED AND PUBLIC
LIBRARIANS ARE URGED TO BE FORWARD-LOOKING AND ENTERPRISING IN ADOPTING
INNOVATIONS.
