YEARS OF CITATEL'.ON

THE EVE OF THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY, THE MAIN POINTS OF THE PERIODICAL'S HISTORY
ARE OUTLINED. IT WAS FOUNDED WITH THE MAIN PURPOSE OF ASSISTING STAFF IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES. WITH TIME, ITS IMPACT HAS SPREAD TO ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES,
IN PARTICULAR IN SLOVAKIA. LIBRARIANS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF NEW, INVENTIVE
IDEAS, BOTH FROM HOME AND ABROAD. THEORY AND PRACTICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE
SOVIET UNION HAS ALWAYS ATTRACTED SPECIAL ATTENTION. ALTHOUGH THE EDUCATIONAL
ROLE OF CITATEL' HAS BEEN EMPHASISED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE, THERE HAS
ALWAYS BEEN ENOUGH SPACE ON ITS PAGES TO ADVISE LIBRARIANS OF IMPROVEMENT IN
WORKING CONDITIONS, AND TO CAMPAIGN FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW LIBRARIES.
TODAY, CITATEL' IS WELL ESTABLISHED NOT ONLY IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA, BUT IT ALSO
HAS A GOOD REPUTATION ABROAD, AND INTEREST IN IT IS ON THE INCREASE.
