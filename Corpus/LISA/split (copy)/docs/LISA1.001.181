LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

COVERS THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION IN THE USA. BEGINS
WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NETWORKS, DESCRIBING THE ROLE OF OCLC AND ADOPTION
OF MARC. THE 2ND STEP IS SEEN AS THE GROWTH OF ON-LINE DATA BASES, WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO LOCKHEED, SDC AND BRS. COSTS, THOUGH, HAVE DETERRED
FULL USE OF THESE. MAKES A CASE FOR STANDARDISATION OF FORMATS. THE EFFECT OF
ON-LINE SYSTEMS ON RETRIEVAL IS RELATED TO THE INCREASING INTEREST IN DOCUMENT
DELIVERY SYSTEMS. NOTES THE CONTRIBUTION OF MINI- AND MICROCOMPUTERS TO THIS
AREA. CENTRALISED SHARED SYSTEMS HAVE ALLOWED AUTOMATION TO PROGRESS. ALL THIS
NEEDS PARALLELING IN THE LIBRARY SCHOOLS WHICH HAVE DIFFICULTY IN PROVIDING
THE FACILITIES. THE REAL PROBLEM LIES IN MAKING SYSTEMS USER FRIENDLY. PERHAPS
LIBRARIANS SHOULD CULTIVATE SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN PROGRAMMING, USING EASY
HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGES LIKE FORTH AND SPEAKEASY. WORD PROCESSORS ALSO WILL NEED
TO BE A STANDARD PART OF LIBRARY  EQUIPMENT. THE FUTURE MUST LIE IN ACHIEVING
ACCESS TO ALL INFORMATION FROM A TERMINAL.
