THE EFFECT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERS ON LIBRARY AND RESEARCH STAFF.

DESCRIBES THE CONVERSION OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH
SERVICE'S CURRENT AWARENESS SERVICE FROM A MANUAL TO AN AUTOMATED MODE,
EMPHASISING THE EFFECTS OF AUTOMATION UPON STAFF AND CLIENTELE. ALTHOUGH
INITIALLY THE CONVERSION WAS ATTENDED BY VARIOUS STAFF AND EQUIPMENT PROBLEMS,
FULL SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION WAS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL. AUTOMATION PRODUCED NO
SAVING IN EITHER TIME OR STAFF; RATHER THE CONTRARY. HOWEVER THE TRUE BENEFITS
OF AUTOMATION APPEAR AS A MULTIPLICITY OF PREVIOUSLY UNOBTAINABLE SERVICES AND
PRODUCTS OF FAR-RANGING UTILITY TO SYSTEM USERS.
