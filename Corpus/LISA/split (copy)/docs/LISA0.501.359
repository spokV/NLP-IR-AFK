ON THE FORMATION OF THE SPECIAL RULES CONCERNING PRINTED MUSIC FOR RAK.

WORK ON THE SPECIAL RULES CONCERNING THE CATALOGUING OF BOTH PRINTED MUSIC AND
SOUND RECORDINGS WHICH WILL BE A SUPPLEMENT TO RAK (REGELN FUR DIE
ALPHABETISCHE KATALOGISIERUNG-RULES FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING) IS ALMOST
COMPLETE. IT WILL BE KNOWN AS RAK-MUSIK. WORK HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT SINCE 1971
BY A COMMITTEE ATTACHED TO THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE'S COMMISSION FOR
ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING. TERMS USED IN RAK WERE REPLACED WITH SIMILAR ONES
FROM THE WORLD OF MUSIC AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. DURING THE PREPARATION PERIOD
SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS APPEARED WHICH WERE USED IN COMPILING THE RULES. THE ISBD
(INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION) FOR NON-BOOK MATERIAL WAS
PUBLISHED IN PARTS BETWEEN 1977-79. ALTHOUGH THE SECTION ON SOUND RECORDINGS
WAS NOT DETAILED ENOUGH, THE ISBD (PRINTED MUSIC) WAS SO COMPLEX THAT ONLY
SOME PARTS WERE SELECTED FOR INCLUSION. IN FUTURE THE RAK MUSIC RULES SHOULD
PROVIDE A BASIS FOR MUSIC CATALOGUING.
