ARCHIVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN THE UNITED STATES, 1937 TO PRESENT.
     
FROM ALMOST ITS INCEPTION IN 1937, ARCHIVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING HAS BEEN
PRIMARILY A POST-EMPLOYMENT EFFORT. THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE INDIFFERENCE OF
THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN BOTH THE FIELDS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND HISTORY,
THE 2 MAIN DISCIPLINES FROM WHICH MANUSCRIPT LIBRARIANS AND ARCHIVISTS ARE
DRAWN. BETWEEN 1937-40 AND 1967-70, THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION BECAME
PERIPHERALLY INTERESTED. THE HISTORY PROFESSION HAS BECOME MORE ACTIVE SINCE
THE EARLY 1970S IN ITS SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE CAREERS FOR ASPIRING HISTORIANS.
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY SCHOOLS ALSO HAVE BEEN OFFERING ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT COURSES
SINCE THE EARLY 1960S PARTICULARLY. BY LACKING ACADEMIC STATUS, THE AMERICAN
LITERATURE IN THE ARCHIVAL FIELD HAS ALSO BEEN UNDERDEVELOPED, AND THIS HAS
CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLOWNESS IN DEVELOPING ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL CONTROL OF
ARCHIVAL/MANUSCRIPT SOURCES. AN ATTEMPT IN 1967-70 TO DEVELOP AN ARCHIVAL
MANUAL WITHI N A.L.A. DIED ABORNING AND THE HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS AND
SOCIETY OF AMERICAN ARCHIVISTS HAVE JUST BEGUN TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEM
INDEPENDENTLY. PRACTICING ARCHIVISTS OF NECESSITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN
TEACHER POOL AND CONTRIBUTORS TO THE LITERATURE UNTIL REGULAR FACULTY IN
LIBRARY SCHOOLS AND HISTORY DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY TRAINED, BUT 1ST
A BASIC REORIENTATION MUST OCCUR THAT RECOGNISES THAT RECORDS AND PAPERS OF
CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY ARE THE CENTRAL PROBLEM.
