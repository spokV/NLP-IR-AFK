PLANNING FOR NEW INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
     
LOW COST COMPUTING HARDWARE WITH INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE IS
PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW, OR THE REVISION OF
EXISTING, INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE PROCEDURES WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN THE
PLANNING STAGE OF SUCH SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE COSTS INVOLVED AND
THE DECISION MAKING IS MORE IN THE HANDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OR UNIT WITHIN AN
ORGANISATION THAN IT WAS. A STAGED PROCEDURE WITH A CHECKLIST OF ACTIVITIES,
APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION AND CONSIDERATIONS TO BE TAKEN AT EACH STAGE IS 1
WAY TO REDUCE THE CHANCES OF ERROR IN THE DECISIONS MADE IN THE PLANNING
PROCESS.
