GETTING DOWN TO 2%: BOOKS FOR RURAL SCOTLAND.

2% OF THE MAINLAND SCOTTISH POPULATION ARE SPREAD OVER 70% OF THE LAND. THIS
RELATIVELY LOW POPULATION DENSITY AND GEOGRAPHICAL COMPLICATIONS LIMIT THE
POTENTIAL OF RURAL MOBILE LIBRARIES; THERE ARE NO STANDARDS; AND THERE IS NO
PHILOSOPHY OF MOBILE SERVICE AND ITS ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY. A QUESTIONNAIRE
WAS SENT TO SCOTTISH AUTHORITIES RUNNING MOBILE SERVICES AND SEVERAL WERE
VISITED TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON POLICIES CONCERNING MOBILES; USAGE; TIME
SPENT AT STOPS, TRAVELLING, AND ON MAINTENANCE; STAFFING; ISSUE FIGURES; BOOK
SELECTION; OTHER STOCK; STOCK CHANGES; ISSUE SYSTEM; VEHICLE CARE; PROBLEMS;
OTHER RURAL SERVICES; EFFECT OF MOBILE COSTS ON FUTURE ROLE AND EXTENT OF
MOBILE SERVICES; AND EFFECTS OF BUDGET CUTS. THE RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED.
