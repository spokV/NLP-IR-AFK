PLANNING A WAGON LIBRARY SERVICE FOR THE SR-6 STATE RAILWAY NETWORK, RIO
GRANDE DO SUL, BRAZIL.

A PROJECT PRESENTED TO THE BRAZILIAN RAILWAY BORAD IN 1980, BASED ON PREVIOUS
EXPERIENCE WITH MOBILE LIBRARIES. THE WAGON LIBRARY WOULD CIRCULATE THROUGHOUT
THE NETWORK HOOKED UP TO A PASSENGER TRAIN; THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS IN
PROMOTING READING ARE DISCUSSED, AND DETAILS GIVEN OF THE ESTIMATED STAFF,
STOCK, AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED. PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATING AND CONTROLLING THE
SERVICE ARE OUTLINED, AND A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WHICH
COULD OPERATE FROM THE WAGON AS A BASE SUGGESTED.
