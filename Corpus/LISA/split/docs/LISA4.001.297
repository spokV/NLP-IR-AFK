AIDS UNLIMITED' THE SCOPE FOR MACHINE AIDS IN A LARGE ORGANIZATION.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB TECHNICAL TRANSLATION GROUP CONFERENCE, LONDON,
20 NOV 80. EXAMINES THE TYPES OF MACHINE AID WHICH ARE SUITABLE FOR USE IN A
LARGE TRANSLATING OPERATION SUCH AS THOSE MET IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
INSTITUTIONS. REVIEWS THE WAY IN WHICH THESE MACHINE AIDS ARE ALREADY BEING
USED IN LARGE ORGANISATIONS AND EXAMINES THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY CAN BE OF
BENEFIT TO THE RUNNING OF THE WHOLE ORGANISATION. WARNS OF POSSIBLE
DIFFICULTIES IN INTRODUCING THEM. IF THESE DIFFICULTIES CAN BE OVERCOME, MANY
ADVANTAGES CAN BE GAINED IN A LARGE ORGANISATION BY INTRODUCING A
FULLY-INTEGRATED WORD-PROCESSING SYSTEM IN WHICH ALL TEXTS ARE STORED IN
ELECTRONIC ARCHIVES AND CAN BE TRANSMITTED ELECTRONICALLY FROM 1 WORK STATION
TO ANOTHER, AND FROM 1 COUNTRY TO ANOTHER.
