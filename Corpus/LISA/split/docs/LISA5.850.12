PLANNING INTERLENDING SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

BASED ON REPORTS DESCRIBING THE EXTENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN
SYSTEMS IN SEVERAL OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, A COMPOSITE IS DRAWN OF THE
DIFFICULTIES AND PROBLEMS WHICH ARISE IN THE PLANNING STAGES AND EXECUTION OF
SUCH SYSTEMS IN THESE COUNTRIES. FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, AS WELL AS PROBLEMS OF
LIBRARY POLICY, AND THE REALISTIC POSSIBILITIES CONNECTED WITH THE LITERATURE
SUPPLY AND CORRESPONDING NEED FOR AN INTERLIBRARY LOAN PROGRAMME IN THESE
COUNTRIES ARE POINTED OUT. ATTENTION IS ALSO GIVEN TO THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE
LOCAL LIBRARIES TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY. CONSIDERATIONS WHICH SHOULD BE MADE
IN FINDING REALISTIC SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS CONCLUDE
THE REPORT.
