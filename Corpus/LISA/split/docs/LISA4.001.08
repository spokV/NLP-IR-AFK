THE POSITION OF THE BOOK IN FINLAND.
     
FINLAND HAS PROPORTIONATELY A VERY LARGE NATIONAL BOOK PRODUCTION (710 VOLUMES
PER MILLION POPULATION IN 1970, AS AGAINST 280 IN USA). BOOK LOANS/SALES HAVE
INCREASED FROM 17.4/4.9 PER HEAD IN 1950 TO 32.4/13.6 IN 1970, WHILE THE
PROPORTION OF FICTION PUBLISHED FELL FROM ONE-THIRD TO 10-15%. LIBRARY LOANS
INCREASED SEVENFOLD DURING 1945-70, WHILE BORROWERS INCREASED FROM 8% TO 26%
OF POPULATION. THE FIRST MOBILE LIBRARY APPEARED IN 1961; BY 1971 THERE WERE
73, LENDING 8% OF THE NATIONAL TOTAL. BOOK-CLUBS CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS AUTHORS'
ROYALTIES AND GRANTS. FINNISH AUTHORS ARE LESS WELL SUBSIDISED THAN NORWEGIAN,
BUT THEIR BOOKS SELL IN LARGER QUANTITIES.
