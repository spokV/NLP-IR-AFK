REMARKS ON THE PRE-PRINT OF RAK-WB.
     
THE RAK-WB (REGELN FUR DIE ALPHABETISCHE KATALOGISIERUNG IN
'WISSENSCHAFTLICHEN BIBLIOTHEKEN')-RULES FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING IN
RESEARCH LIBRARIES-HAVE BEEN COMPILED TO CORRESPOND TO THE SPECIFIC SITUATION
IN RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND FULFIL THEIR PURPOSE WHICH IS TO BRIDGE THE TIME GAP
UNTIL RAK IS PUBLISHED IN BOOK FORM. RAK-WB PROVIDES A BASIS FOR CATALOGUING
IN RESEARCH LIBRARIES DEMONSTRATING THE DESIRED UNIFORMITY IN ALL IMPORTANT
POINTS. ITS USE WILL LEAD TO UNIFORM PROCESSING AT ALL STAGES OF
CLASSIFICATION WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR COOPERATIVE CATALOGUING AND DATA
EXCHANGE. ITS VALUE IS INCREASED BY THE MANY AMENDMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS WHICH
WENT INTO ITS MAKE-UP AS A RESULT OF YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE WITH RAK.
RAK-WB HAS BEEN QUICKLY ADOPTED BY THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS.
IT IS HOPED THAT THE PLANNED RAK-OB FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES WILL BE OF A
COMPARABLE STANDARD.
