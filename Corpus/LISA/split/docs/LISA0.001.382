SUBJECT HEADING LIST.

THE PRESENT FINNISH SUBJECT HEADING LIST DATES FROM 1941. A SUBJECT HEADING
PILOT WORKING GROUP SET UP BY THE FINNISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION HAS COMPLETED
ITS PILOT SURVEY. THE GROUP INCLUDED LIBRARIANS FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF
LIBRARIES. THE PURPOSES OF THE PILOT WAS TO RECOMMEND THAT A COMPILATION OF A
SUBJECT HEADING LIST SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AND TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE WORK. THE LIST WOULD SERVE ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES AND
WOULD BE MORE FLEXIBLE THAN A CLASSIFICATION. A THESAURUS STRUCTURE WOULD BE
BEST FOR THE PURPOSE. THE LIST SHOULD INCLUDE BETWEEN 10,000 AND 20,000 TERMS.
A WORKING GROUP SHOULD BE SET UP BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION THIS YEAR. THE
BUDGET FOR THE WORK LASTING 3 YEARS IS ESTIMATED AT 385,000 FINN MARKS.
