SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES AND INTERLENDING SCHEMES.
     
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES ARE LEADERS IN THE FIELD OF INTERLIBRARY
LENDING IN BULGARIA. A SURVEY CARRIED OUT IN 53 SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
LIBRARIES IN THE PERIOD 1977-79 SHOWED AN INCREASE IN INTERLENDING PARTNERS,
RANGING ON AVERAGE FROM 6-9, BUT SOME LIBRARIES MAINTAINING CONTACTS WITH 14,
20, OR EVEN 27 COUNTERPARTS. INTERNATIONAL INTERLENDING WAS SLIGHTLY UNDER
10%, AND INTERLENDING FROM CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARIES ONLY 5%. THE GREATEST
DEMAND WAS FOR PERIODICALS, CATALOGUES AND PATENTS, FOLLOWED BY BOOKS AND
TRANSLATIONS. DURING THE SURVEY, LIBRARIANS PUT FORWARD MANY USEFUL
SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT, DIRECTED MOST FREQUENTLY AT THE CENTRAL TECHNICAL
LIBRARY AND/OR AT THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY.
