THE JAPANESE WORD PROCESSOR JW-10.
     
DESCRIBES THE JAPANESE WORD PROCESSOR JW-10, WHICH IS THE 1ST SUCH PROCESSOR
IN THE WORLD. THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECT IN DEVELOPING A JAPANESE WORD
PROCESSOR IS FINDING AN EASY INPUT METHOD FOR THE NUMEROUS CHINESE CHARACTERS
USED IN JAPANESE. FOR TEXT INPUT, JW-10 PERFORMS A KARA-TO-KANJI
(PHONOGRAM-TO-IDEOGRAM) TRANSLATION THROUGH GRAMMATIC ANALYSIS AND
CONSULTATION WITH AN 80,000-WORD DICTIONARY.
