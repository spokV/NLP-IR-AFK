ARE MOBILE LIBRARIES A PROFITABLE MEANS OF PROVIDING LITERATURE FOR
STRUCTURALLY WEAK AREAS?.
     
LITERATURE PROVISION FOR RURAL AREAS HAS ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT. A COMPARISON
BETWEEN MOBILE AND SMALL VILLAGE LIBRARIES SHOWS THAT MOBILE LIBRARIES ARE,
CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION, CHEAPER TO RUN; THEY HAVE LARGER AND MORE
FREQUENTLY CHANGED STOCKS AND DO NOT HAVE TO PAY OVERHEADS FOR HEATING AND
LIGHTING. VILLAGE LIBRARIES CANNOT BE CULTURAL CRYSTALLISATION CENTRES IF
THEIR STOCKS ARE INADEQUATE. CHILDREN ARE THE MAIN USERS OF VILLAGE LIBRARIES,
WHICH THEREFORE STOCK MAINLY CHILDREN'S BOOKS. MOBILE LIBRARIES CARRY A LARGER
PROPORTION OF ADULT MATERIAL; FEWER CHILDREN'S BOOKS ARE NEEDED HERE SINCE THE
CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD SCHOOL LIBRARIES. GOOD QUALITY LITERATURE
PROVISION IS ALWAYS PROFITABLE AND IN CONTRAST WITH VILLAGE LIBRARIES, MOBILE
LIBRARIES ALWAYS HAVE QUALIFIED STAFF. THE TRAVELLING LIBRARY IS A GOOD
ADVERTISEMENT FOR LIBRARY SERVICES.
