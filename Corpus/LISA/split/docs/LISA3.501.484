MAILPHONE' A DEMONSTRATION OF MAN-MACHINE RELATIONS IN ELECTRONIC MAIL
NETWORKING.
     
THIS TECHNICAL REPORT COVERING A 12-MONTH PERIOD (JULY '80-JUNE '81) DESCRIBES
THE DESIGN OF THE MAILPHONE. THE INTENT OF THIS PROJECT IS TO SHOW THAT NEW
APPROACHES TO MAN-COMPUTER INTERFACE DESIGN CAN OVERCOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS
ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNDERUTILISATION OF MILITARY COMPUTER SYSTEMS. THE
MILITARY COMPUTER SYSTEM SELECTED FOR IMPROVEMENT WAS THE ARPANET ELECTRONIC
MAIL SYSTEM. THE MMR IMPROVEMENTS WERE REALISED BY A COMPLETE REDESIGN OF THE
ELECTRONIC MAIL INTERFACE, AND DEMONSTRATED BY THE MAILPHONE, A
MICROPROCESSOR-BASED SYSTEM FEATURING A DESK TOP UNIT PURPOSELY DESIGNED TO
RESEMBLE THE FAMILIAR TELEPHONE. THE MAILPHONE, WHILE COMPLEX TECHNOLOGICALLY,
IS DESIGNED TO BE OPERATIONALLY BOTH SIMPLE AND FRIENDLY.
