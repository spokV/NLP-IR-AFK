THE QUALITY OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION ANALYSIS.
     
A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1979 BRAZILIAN CONFERENCE. WHILE INFORMATION CONTROL
AND DOCUMENT ACCESS TECHNIQUES HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF
AUTOMATED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY, IT IS ON THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION INPUT THAT THE EFFICIENCY OF
AUTOMATED SYSTEMS DEPENDS. INFORMATION PROCESSING SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO
THE PROCEDURES FOR SYSTEMS ORGANISATION AND ADMINISTRATION, AND LINKED
DIRECTLY TO INFORMATION DISSEMINATION SERVICES. THE CHIEF FACTOR GOVERNING
QUALITY OF SYSTEM INPUT IS INFORMATION ANALYSIS, AND IN BRAZIL THIS IS ALMOST
TOTALLY NEGLECTED.
