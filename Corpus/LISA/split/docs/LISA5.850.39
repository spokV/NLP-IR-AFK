THESIS/DISSERTATION PROCESSING AND OCLC.

AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE IMPACT THAT OCLC CAN HAVE ON CATALOGUING PROCEDURES, AN
EXAMINATION OF THE HANDLING OF THESES AND DISSERTATIONS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF
ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN LIBRARY DEMONSTRATES THAT CONSIDERABLE SAVINGS
CAN BE REALISED WITHOUT SACRIFICING OR ELIMINATING SEVERAL SPECIAL FILES WHICH
ARE USED EXTENSIVELY BY LIBRARY STAFF AND PATRONS WHILE MAKING THE MATERIALS
AVAILABLE FOR PATRON USE MUCH MORE QUICKLY.
