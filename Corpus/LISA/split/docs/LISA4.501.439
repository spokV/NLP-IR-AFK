CARRY OUT A READING CAMPAIGN IN YOUR CLASS.
     
A READING CAMPAIGN WAS CARRIED OUT IN CLASS 3B OF ISLEV SCHOOL IN RODOVRE,
DENMARK, IN WHICH THE PUPILS AIMED TO READ AT HOME A TOTAL OF 200 BOOKS FROM
THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN 9 WEEKS. THE READERS WERE GIVEN A TIME IN WHICH TO READ
EACH BOOK AND USED A FORM TO REPORT ON THE CONTENT, ILLUSTRATIONS AND EASE OF
READING. THESE COMMENTS WERE READ TO THE CLASS EACH WEEK. THE 1ST BATCH OF
BOOKS WAS CHOSEN BY THE 2 TEACHERS CONCERNED, THE NEXT BY TEACHERS AND PUPILS
TOGETHER IN THE LIBRARY, AND THE LAST MAINLY BY THE PUPILS THEMSELVES. IF NO
BOOK ATTRACTED A CHILD, HE OR SHE COULD CHOSE 1 FROM THE LIBRARY WITH HELP
FROM THE LIBRARIAN. A 'BOOK THERMOMETER' IN THE CLASSROOM SHOWED PROGRESS IN
READING THE 200 BOOKS. AN EXHIBITION ON THE PROJECT WAS MOUNTED IN THE LIBRARY
AND A TAPE WAS MADE OF SOME OF THE READERS' OPINIONS. THE CAMPAIGN STIMULATED
INTEREST IN READING AND IN BORROWING BOOKS FROM THE SCHOOL LIBRARY AND SOME
CHILDREN WHO HAD NEVER READ A BOOK BEFORE NOW DID SO, SOMETIMES AS A RESULT OF
THE RECORDED COMMENTS. THE AIM WAS FULFILLED, ALL 200 BOOKS BEING READ DURING
THE 9-WEEK PERIOD.
