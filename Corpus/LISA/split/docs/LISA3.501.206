A VIEW OF THE FUTURE OF LIBRARY NETWORKING.
     
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARY NETWORKS WILL INCLUDE GROWTH OF COMPUTER-BASED
NETWORKS IN NUMBER AND VARIETY OF LIBRARIES, IN USE OF VARIOUS SUBSYSTEMS, AND
IN SIZE OF DATA BASES USED. SERVICES PROVIDED BY ON-LINE SYSTEMS WILL EXPAND
TO INCLUDE IMPROVED SUBJECT ACCESS, ON-LINE CATALOGUES, SERIALS LISTS AND
INVENTORY CONTROL, ACQUISITIONS FUNCTIONS, INTERLIBRARY LENDING, CIRCULATION,
AND REFERENCE SERVICES. ADDITIONAL SERVICES WILL INCLUDE HOME DELIVERY OF
INFORMATION, TEXT TRANSMISSION, HOME-COMPUTING SUPPORT, LIBRARY MANAGEMENT
SYSTEMS, AND INTERFACE BETWEEN BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITIES. INCREASING INTERACTION
IS BREAKING OPEN THE ARTIFICIAL COMPARTMENTS IN WHICH LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS
HAVE SEEN THEMSELVES. THE DEMANDS PLACED ON LIBRARY PERSONNEL IN NETWORK
DEVELOPMENT WILL NEED CONTINUED EXERCISE OF SKILL, KNOWLEDGE, AND INTEGRITY AS
THE COLLECTIVE COMMON SENSE WORKS FOR THE COMMON GOOD.
