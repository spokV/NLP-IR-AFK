FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS ON ROMANIZATION' SAUDI ARABIA.

DEPLORES THE ROMANISATION OF ARABIC CHARACTERS IN ORDER THAT CATALOGUE ENTRIES
FOR ARABIC LITERATURE CAN BE FILED IN THE SAME SEQUENCE AS THOSE FOR WESTERN
LITERATURE. MAINTAINS THAT ARABIC ENTRIES SHOULD BE IN A SEPARATE SEQUENCE,
AND THAT ROMANISATION IS UNNECESSARY. LINGUISTIC EQUALITY SHOULD BE A BASIS
FOR THE FORGING OF NEW RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE ARAB AND THE WESTERN WORLDS.
