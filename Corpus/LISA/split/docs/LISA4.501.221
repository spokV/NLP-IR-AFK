THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBRARY PROFESSION AS A PROFESSION FOR WOMEN.
     
SURVEYS THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND, THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND UP TO THE 1920S, THE
QUALIFICATIONS AND PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS REQUIRED OF WOMEN IN
LIBRARIANSHIP, AS WELL AS THEIR PART IN LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS. WOMEN FIRST
BECAME ACCEPTED IN LIBRARIANSHIP WHEN THERE WERE INSUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF MEN
AVAILABLE. THE WOMEN, MOSTLY FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS, RUSHED INTO A PROFESSION
WHICH DID NOT DETRACT FROM SOCIAL PRESTIGE. STEREOTYPED IDEAS CONCERNING
FEMALE QUALITIES MADE THEIR ENTRANCE INTO THE PROFESSION EASIER' ACCURACY,
INDUSTRY, SELF-DENIAL AND SUBORDINATION ON THE ONE HAND; SOCIAL SENSITIVITY,
MOTHERLY FEELING AND INSIGHT INTO PEOPLE'S NATURE ON THE OTHER. THE GROWING
NUMBER OF WOMEN IN LIBRARIANSHIP MADE AN ORGAN FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF THEIR
INTERESTS DESIRABLE. THE 'VEREINIGUNG BIBLIOTEKARISCH ARBEITENDER FRAUEN',
FOUNDED IN 1907, MADE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE PAYMENT, INFORM INTERESTED PEOPLE
ABOUT THE PROFESSION AND ABOUT ED UCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP, AND PROVIDED AN
EMPLOYMENT AGENCY. THE ASSOCIATION WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE 'REICHSVERBAND
DEUTSCHER BIBLIOTHEKSBEAMTER UND-ANGESTELLTER' IN 1920.
