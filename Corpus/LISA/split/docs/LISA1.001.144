SCOPAL.

THE 2ND SESSION OF THE STANDING CONFERENCE OF PACIFIC LIBRARIES (SCOPAL) WAS
HELD IN SUVA IN OCT 79. QUESTIONS WERE RAISED THEN AS TO WHETHER IT COULD
OPERATE AS A PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION WITHOUT A CONSTITUTION, MEMBERSHIP FEES
OR OVERT COMPETITION FOR EXECUTIVE POSITIONS. ITS AIMS INCLUDE THE
ENCOURAGEMENT OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT, LIBRARY PROJECTS AND LIAISON WITHIN THE
PACIFIC REGION, AND TO PROVIDE A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL FOR PROJECT WORKERS AND
WORKING GROUPS. ALTHOUGH IT CAN OPERATE ON ITS PRESENT LINES, SCOPAL REALLY
EMBODIES A 'SPIRIT OF REGIONALISM' WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME MOTIVATES
COOPERATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. ITS WEAKNESS IS THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN ITS MEMBERS. THE SPIRIT OF REGIONAL INFORMATION COOPERATION MUST TAKE
FLESH IN ORDER TO BE SEEN AND HEARD BY GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL BODIES AS
WELL AS BY THE LIBRARIANS AND COMMUNITIES WHICH SCOPAL SERVES.
