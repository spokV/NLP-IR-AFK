DESCRIBES ROSKILDE CENTRAL LIBRARY, WHOSE 20 MILLION KR. EXPANSION COMPLETED
IN 1980 WAS APPROVED BEFORE THE CUTS WOULD HAVE MADE SUCH DEVELOPMENT
IMPOSSIBLE. INTERVIEWS MEMBERS OF THE CULTURAL COMMITTEE. SAVINGS HAVE HAD TO
BE MADE IN THE BUDGETS FOR MATERIALS AND STAFF, AND NO NEW ACTIVITIES, APART
FROM A SPOKEN NEWSPAPER, ARE PLANNED. IN AN INTERVIEW, THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN
REGRETS THE CUTS IN MATERIALS AMOUNTING TO 12% AND BLAMES THE FAILURE OF ADULT
LOANS TO INCREASE DRAMATICALLY AFTER THE EXPANSION ON THE LACK OF POPULAR
TITLES. THE VERY LARGE OPEN PLAN ADULT LIBRARY MEANS LONG DISTANCES FOR
LIBRARIANS AND SOME CONFUSION AMONG READERS. THE LACK OF A CONCERT HALL AND
MEETING ROOMS IS FELT. TO MEET THIS NEED, HIRE OF A HALL IN HOTEL PRINDSEN IS
PLANNED. INCLUDES AN ARCHITECTURAL EVALUATION OF THE BUILDING AND ITS
LOCATION. DISCUSSES THE AUTHORITY'S POLICY TOWARDS CLUBS AND CULTURAL
ORGANISATIONS. DESCRIBES THE REFERENCE SECTION, WHERE AN INCREASE IN DEMAND
HAS LED TO PROBLEMS OF LACK OF STAFF. INCLUDES STATISTICS.
