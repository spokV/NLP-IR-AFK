IN TOUCH WITH THE FUTURE.
     
DESCRIBES EVANSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY'S AUTOMATION SYSTEM. IN 1978 THE LIBRARY
INSTALLED AN ON-LINE ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEM BY CLSI. WITH AUTHOR AND TITLE DATA
ALREADY IN THE DATA BASE, THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ON-LINE PUBLIC ACCESS
CATALOGUE WITH A TOUCH SENSITIVE TERMINAL, OPENED IN OCT 80, WAS FACILITATED.
THE CARD CATALOGUE IS, HOWEVER, BEING MAINTAINED, AS THE INPUT OF SUBJECT DATA
IS NOT YET COMPLETE AND AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST COMPUTER BREAK-DOWNS. THE EXTRA
COSTS INVOLVED HAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN, AND SAVINGS ON STAFF ARE NOT YET
POSSIBLE. IT IS, THEREFORE, DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE THE LONG-TERM SAVINGS FROM
AUTOMATION. THE PROFESSIONAL GAINS ARE, HOWEVER, CLEAR' THE CATALOGUE ENABLES
PRECISE LOCATION OF MATERIAL AND COMPILATION OF USEFUL STATISTICS, AND
SIMPLIFIES ALTERATIONS. MOREOVER, TERMINALS CAN BE PLACED OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY,
IN THE TOWN HALL AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.
