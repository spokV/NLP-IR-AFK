PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION AS SEEN FROM A MULTISTATE NETWORK.
     
COOPERATION AMONG US LIBRARIES IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST IS OF LONG STANDING
AND IS AN EXAMPLE OF REGIONAL COOPERATION AMONG PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND OTHER
LIBRARIES THROUGH INTERLIBRARY LOAN, UNION CATALOGUE, UNION LISTS, COOPERATIVE
CATALOGUING, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS BETWEEN 2 COUNTRIES AND OVER A
LARGE AND SPARSELY POPULATED REGION. NETWORKING HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED
SERVICES TO LIBRARY USERS AND IN INCREASED EFFICIENCIES IN LIBRARY OPERATIONS.

THE FORUM PROVIDED AS A RESULT OF THE COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND THE NEED TO
EXTEND THEM INTO THE FUTURE.
