METHODOLOGICAL CENTRES AND THE CONTROL THEY EXERCISE OVER PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE OF THE SLOVAK SOCIALIST REPUBLIC HAS ASSIGNED TO
METHODOLOGICAL CENTRES THE TASK OF PARTICIPATING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC
LIBRARIES IN ALL ITS ASPECTS. THIS IS DONE BY INSPECTION, ADVICE AND FINALLY
SUGGESTION OF SOLUTIONS TO THE LIBRARY'S MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. THE SCOPE OF
THEIR AUTHORITY IS, HOWEVER, NOT QUITE CLEAR. DELEGATION OF GREATER
INDEPENDENCE OF DECISION TO METHODOLOGICAL WORKERS IS DESIRABLE. SOLUTIONS
SUGGESTED FOR METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO DISTRICT AND SIMILAR LIBRARIES ARE
EXPRESSED BY MEANS OF FLOW-CHARTS.
