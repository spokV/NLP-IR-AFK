TALKING TO THE TELEVISION.

BRIGHTON POLYTECHNIC (IN COLLABORATION WITH ITV AND BBC) IS CONDUCTING A
PROJECT TO STUDY THE EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF TELETEXT. 10 SUITABLE
TELEVISION SETS WILL BE PLACED IN SCHOOLS, TEACHING MATERIALS WILL BE PRODUCED
FOR THEM AND THEIR USE WILL BE MONITORED. THE BBC'S CEEFAX, ITV'S ORACLE AND
THE GPO'S PRESTEL FORM THE BASIS FOR THE EXPERIMENT, BUT IT IS FELT THAT THESE
HAVE SHOWN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS FOR EDUCATIONAL USE IN THE PAST. A NEW
DEVELOPMENT, TELESOFTWARE, COULD OVERCOME SUCH LIMITATIONS. TELESOFTWARE
ALLOWS THE USER TO 'TALK' TO THE TELEVISION SET, PAGES OF INFORMATION BECOME
INSTANTLY AVAILABLE, SOME PAGES CAN CARRY INSTRUCTIONS, AND SPECIFIC
PROGRAMMES FOR MICROCOMPUTER USE MAY BE RECEIVED.
