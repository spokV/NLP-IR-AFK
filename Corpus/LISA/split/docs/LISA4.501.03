RESEARCH LIBRARIES AS REFLECTED IN THE GERMAN DAILY PRESS.
     
A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF REFERENCES TO RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN THE WEST GERMAN
DAILY PRESS REVEALS THAT ASPECTS OTHER THEN THE SUBSTANTIAL LIBRARY CONCERNS
DOMINATE. A GREATER INTEREST IN ISSUES DEALING WITH THE COLLECTION AND ITS
CONSERVATION CONSISTENTLY OVERSHADOWS PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THE
LIBRARY. CORRESPONDING TO THIS ACCENTUATION AN UNCRITICAL SATISFACTION WITH
THE WORK OF ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES PREVAILS. IN ADDITION TO THE
SYSTEMATICAL SCOPE OF THE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF 326 NEWSPAPER ARTICLES
INVESTIGATED A SPECIFIC TEXT IS PRESENTED AND INTERPRETED.
