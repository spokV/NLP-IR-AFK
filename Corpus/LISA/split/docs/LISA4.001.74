ARCHIVAL TRAINING IN EUROPE.
     
OVERVIEW OF ARCHIVAL TRAINING IN EUROPE PRESENTING A FRESH PERSPECTIVE ON US
PRACTICE. THE VERY ANTIQUITY OF THE EUROPEAN ARCHIVAL PROFESSION HAS SEEN ITS
CONSTANT TRANSFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL
CONDITIONS. EUROPEANS, MORE THAN AMERICANS, TRADITIONALLY STRESSED THE
ARCHIVIST'S DUAL RESPONSIBILITY AS CUSTODIAN AND INTERPRETER OF THE HISTORICAL
RECORD. AMERICAN ARCHIVISTS SHOULD NOT SLAVISHLY IMITATE THE PRACTICES OF
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, BUT RATHER GARNER THE INSIGHTS BROADER THAN AN EXCLUSIVELY
AMERICAN-ORIENTED DISCUSSION CAN PROVIDE.
