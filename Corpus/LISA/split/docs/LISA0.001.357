THE MEDIA INDEX: COMPUTER-BASED ACCESS TO NONPRINT MATERIALS.

ALTHOUGH FULL BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO NON-PRINT MATERIALS HAS BEEN A GOAL OF
LIBRARIES, COMPLETE SUCCESS HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED. THE LIBRARY AT CALIFORNIA
STATE UNIVERSITY, LOS ANGELES, SOUGHT A WAY TO ACCESS PREVIOUSLY INACCESSIBLE
ELEMENTS OF ITS RECORDINGS COLLECTION. THE COMPUTER-BASED MEDIA INDEX WAS
DESIGNED WITH SEPARATE INDEXES FOR TITLES, SUBJECTS, AND ADDED ENTRIES
(SELECTIONS, COMPOSERS, PERFORMERS, ETC.). THIS HAS PROVED TO BE AN EXTREMELY
USEFUL TOOL AND IS READILY ADAPTABLE TO OTHER FORMS OF MEDIATED MATERIAL.
