WHICH WAY FOR SCHOOL MEDIA SERVICES TO TURN?.

IN THE NETHERLANDS THERE HAS BEEN MUCH DISCUSSION IN RECENT YEARS ON THE
TRANSFER OF SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICES FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES. IN THE PRESENT SITUATION OF
CUTBACKS IN PUBLIC LIBRARY FINANCES THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT FOR SUCH A
TRANSFER. HOWEVER, SCHOOL LIBRARIANS EMPLOYED BY THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
AUTHORITIES, ARE AS MUCH A PART OF THE SCHOOL 'SUPPORT' STAFF AS EDUCATIONAL
PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SOCIAL WORKERS ALSO FOUND IN SCHOOLS. LIBRARIANS EXPERIENCED
IN THE PROVISION OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARY SERVICES ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO
ORGANISE SCHOOL LIBRARIES WITH THEIR GROWING COLLECTIONS OF AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIALS AS WELL AS THEIR BOOKSTOCK.
