FUNCTIONS AND AIMS OF ITALIAN SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
     
BOOKS BY THEMSELVES DO NOT CREATE A SCHOOL LIBRARY. IT SHOULD CONSTITUTE AN
INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION PROCESSES, INTERACTING
WITH THE PUPIL. CLASSIFIED CATALOGUES COMBINED WITH OPEN ACCESS HAVE AN
IMPORTANT ROLE. THE SCHEME WILL USUALLY BE DEWEY DECIMAL OR OCCASIONALLY
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS BUT THE FLEXIBLE COLON CLASSIFICATION ALSO MERITS
CONSIDERATION.
