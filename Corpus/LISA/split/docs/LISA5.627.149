PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND INFORMATION ARRANGEMENT.

DESCRIBES AN ATTEMPT BY ASLIB TO DEVELOP A CHECKLIST FOR THE EVALUATION OF
INFORMATION SERVICES COVERING CURRENT AWARENESS SERVICES, INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL SERVICES, DOCUMENT DELIVERY AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS EVALUATION
ACTIVITIES. THERE WAS LITTLE SUPPORT FROM PRACTITIONERS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
GUIDELINES RELATING TO SPECIFIC ITEMS IN THE CHECKLIST BUT CHOOSING BETWEEN AN
IN-HOUSE DATA BASE AND RELIANCE ON EXTERNAL SUPPLIES WAS SEEN AS AN ISSUE OF
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE. SUGGESTS THE NEED FOR A 'USER-FRIENDLY' PACKAGE BRINGING
TOGETHER THE BEST OF THE LITERATURE ON PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TO ENCOURAGE
ITS WIDESPREAD ADOPTION.
