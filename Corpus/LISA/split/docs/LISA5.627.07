EVALUATING COLLECTIONS BY THEIR USE.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION,
NEW YORK, JULY 80. DISCUSSES SOME METHODS OF EVALUATING A LIBRARY COLLECTION
IN TERMS OF THE VOLUME AND TYPE OF USE IT RECEIVES. DESCRIBES THE FINDINGS OF
SEVERAL STUDIES OF CIRCULATION PATTERNS, INCLUDING SOME DERIVED FROM MACHINE
READABLE RECORDS. DISCUSSES THE APPLICATION, AND RELATIVE ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES OF 2 TYPES OF STUDIES OF COLLECTION USE-DOCUMENT DELIVERY TESTS,
AND SHELF AVAILABILITY STUDIES. INDICATES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AND LIMITATIONS
ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH STUDIES, AND POINTS OUT THAT A CONSIDERABLE ADVANCE WILL
BE MADE WHEN THE METHODOLOGIES NOW APPLIED TO ONE-TIME EVALUATIONS ARE
MODIFIED SO THAT THEY CAN BE USED IN CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF PERFORMANCE.
