PROGRAMMING IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES' A DISSENTING VIEWPOINT.

THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF PROGRAMMING (THE OFFERING ON NON-BOOK ACTIVITIES IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES) HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN BY MANY LIBRARIANS, BUT HAS BEEN
JUSTIFIED IN SEVERAL WAYS. ADVOCATES THAT THE COMMONEST METHOD IS NOT TO
JUSTIFY IT AT ALL; IN MANY CASES PROGRAMMING IS INEFFECTIVE, AND LITTLE
RIGOROUS EVALUATION HAS EVER BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO PROVE THAT PROGRAMMING CAN
SUCCEED. QUESTIONS THE COMMON UNTHINKING ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEED FOR
PROGRAMMING, AND CITES ANNUAL REPORTS AND STUDIES WHICH INDICATE THE NEED FOR
BETTER EVALUATION THAN HAS HERETOFORE BEEN THE PRACTICE.
