CHILDREN ARE THE LOSERS-THEY DO NOT LEARN THE HABIT OF USING THE LIBRARY.
     
THE REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION TO THE
ANNUAL MEETING HELD IN OCT 81. WOULD LIKE TO SEE EDUCATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS
BETTER INFORMED ABOUT THE WORK OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND THEIR PLACE IN THE
SCHOOLS. THE TRAINING OF SCHOOL LIBRARIANS AT THE DANISH TEACHERS' HIGH SCHOOL
HAS SUFFERED FROM CUTS AND STANDARDS HAVE BEEN LOWERED. COMMENTS ON THE LATEST
PROPOSAL FOR A LIBRARY BILL AND CRITICISES THE DECISION TO PLACE SCHOOL
LIBRARIES UNDER THE SCHOOLS ACT. IF THEY ARE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE SCHOOLS
ACT THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE THEIR OWN BY-LAWS STIPULATING COOPERATION WITH
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND AN INDEPENDENT BUDGET. THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT ALLOW FOR
THESE. DISCUSSES A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR THE ASSOCIATION AND ARGUES FOR THE
CONTINUED NEED FOR SEPARATE ASSOCIATIONS FOR CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES AND SCHOOL
LIBRARIES, BUT WITH CLOSE COOPERATION.
