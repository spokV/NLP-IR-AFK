AN ANALYSIS OF THE METHODS USED TO CONVEY INFORMATION ON COMPLEX BIOCHEMICAL
STRUCTURES, BY REPRESENTATIONS AND CODING SYSTEMS.
     
(MSC THESIS.) REPRESENTATIONS ARE VITAL FOR THE COMMUNICATION OF PROTEIN
STRUCTURAL INFORMATION. THESE REPRESENTATIONS CAN BE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO
BIOCHEMICAL STRUCTURE, AND VARY IN COMPLEXITY AND METHOD OF PRODUCTION. MANY
TYPES OF REPRESENTATION ARE NECESSARY TO FULLY DOCUMENT A PROTEIN STRUCTURE.
INVESTIGATES THE PRIMARY LITERATURE OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE, AND THE METHODS USED
BY BIOCHEMICAL AND CHEMICAL DATA BASES IN HANDLING PROTEIN STRUCTURES.
EXPLORES ASPECTS OF NOMENCLATURE OF PROTEINS AND CODING SYSTEMS FOR PROTEINS,
AND THE SUITABILITY OF NOERR STRUCTURES FOR STORING BIOCHEMICAL STRUCTURE.
