UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' STANDARDS AND STATISTICS.
     
THE ARL-ACRL STANDARDS FOR UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES DO NOT PRESENT QUANTITATIVE
STANDARDS, BUT RATHER PLACE THEIR EMPHASIS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES. THROUGH THE STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES OF CORRELATION AND REGRESSION,
DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS, AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS IT IS POSSIBLE TO
ANALYSE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY DATA AND TO DERIVE MINIMAL CRITERIA THAT
STATISTICALLY DISTINGUISH UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES FROM OTHER KINDS OF ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES. THESE CRITERIA LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE STANDARDS, BUT STILL FAIL TO
RELATE LIBRARY SIZE AND RESOURCES DEPLOYED TO LIBRARY PERFORMANCE.
