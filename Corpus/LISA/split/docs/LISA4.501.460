VIEWPOINT' CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN BRAZIL. THE LITERARY CRITIC.
     
DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF THE CRITIC IN ADVISING PARENTS, TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS
IN SELECTING READING MATERIAL THAT WILL ENRICH A CHILD'S EXPERIENCE. DESCRIBES
THE AESTHETIC AND EDUCATIONAL QUALITIES OF GOOD WRITING; THEN DISTINGUISHES
THIS CATEGORY FROM MEDIOCRE WRITING BASED ON CHEAP FANTASY AND FORCED REALISM
ON THE ONE HAND, AND FROM STRAIGHT DIDACTIC PROPAGANDA ON THE OTHER. THE
NECESSITY OF ENCOURAGING A LITERATURE OF RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY, AND
DISCOURAGING THE PERNICIOUS EVIL OF SUBLITERARY PRODUCTIONS, IS EMPHASISED.
