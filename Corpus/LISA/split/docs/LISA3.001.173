THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES ARE LIMPING SADLY BEHIND-SHOWS NEW REPORT ON THE
CONDITIONS OF RESEARCH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR.
     
ACCORDING TO A REPORT ISSUED IN APRIL 81 BY THE RESEARCH SECRETARIAT, DENMARK
LAGS BEHIND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN ITS SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH, BOTH PUBLIC
AND PRIVATE. THE REPORT DEALS SEPARATELY WITH RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND DESCRIBES
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CUTS BOTH FOR LIBRARIES AND THEIR MOTHER INSTITUTIONS;
IT SHOWS THAT THE LIBRARIES USE LESS THAN 10% OF THE EXPENDITURE ON RESEARCH.
INCLUDES COMMENTS ON THE REPORT BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE JOINT
COUNCIL OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS THE CONCLUSION THAT THE
RESEARCH LIBRARIES' ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SHOULD BE SOLVED IN CONJUNCTION WITH,
AND PREFERABLY BEFORE, ANY CHANGE IN THEIR STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT. IT POINTS
OUT THAT FIGURES FOR RUNNING COSTS OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES UNDER THE CULTURAL
MINISTRY, AFTER ADJUSTMENT, SHOW A GREATER FALL THAN OF THOSE UNDER THE
EDUCATION MINISTRY.
