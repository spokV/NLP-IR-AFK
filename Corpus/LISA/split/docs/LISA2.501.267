INFORMATION BY, AND RELATIONS OF THE HOSPITAL PHARMACIST WITH THE LIBRARY
INFORMATION NETWORK.
     
HOSPITALS INCREASINGLY DEMAND QUICK AND SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION.
AT THE DISPENSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL SCHOOL OF SZEGED, INFORMATION
REQUESTS IN 1979 WERE ANALYSED. 20% REFERRED TO INDICATION, 11% EACH TO
TECHNOLOGY AND ACCESSIBILITY. &L OF THE INFORMATION REQUIRED HIGH
QUALIFICATION, THE OTHER &D RELATED TO ECONOMICS. PHARMACISTS NEED UP-TO-DATE
INFORMATION, BUT HUNGARIAN UNIVERSITY PHARMACIES HAVE NO ON-LINE SYSTEM. IN
ADDITION TO THE SERVICES OFFERED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL
INFORMATION AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PHARMACY, PHARMACISTS RELY SOLELY ON
THEIR OWN DOCUMENTATION SYSTEMS. A CARD-FILE SYSTEM INCLUDING ABSTRACTS HAS
BEEN DEVELOPED. PHARMACISTS IN SZEGED ALSO USE THE LIBRARIES OF THE MEDICAL
UNIVERSITY AND THE FACULTY OF PHARMACOLOGY. AT PRESENT, INFORMATION SUPPLY
MEETS REQUIREMENTS.
