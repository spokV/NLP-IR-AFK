ON THE REALISATION OF USER TRAINING FOR STUDENTS AT A COLLEGE OF EDUCATION.
     
THE PROGRESS OF USER TRAINING FOR STUDENTS AT THE ERFURT/MULHAUSEN COLLEGE OF
EDUCATION WAS OUTLINED AT A MEETING OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' STUDY GROUP
AT THE MINISTRY FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION (MINISTERIUM FUR VOLKSBILDUNG) IN JUNE
80. IT HAS PROVED DIFFICULT TO INTEREST ALL THE TEACHERS AT THE COLLEGE IN THE
SUBJECT AND TO IMPRESS ON THEM THE IMPORTANCE OF USER TRAINING TO THE
STUDENTS. IT IS PLANNED TO HOLD MEETINGS AND DISCUSSIONS TO SHOW TEACHERS
METHODS OF USER TRAINING AND OF PUTTING THE ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE TO THE TEST.
STUDENT USER TRAINING CONSISTS OF A TOUR AROUND THE LIBRARY, AND LIBRARY
DEPARTMENTS, LECTURES IN COLLEGE AND AT THE LIBRARY AND PRACTICAL TESTS IN
USING CATALOGUES AND OTHER INFORMATION SOURCES. THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED BY THE
STUDENTS SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN WORKING INDEPENDENTLY IN THE CATALOGUE SECTION,
USING A WIDER RANGE OF REFERENCE LITERATURE AND PREPARING THEIR FINAL THESIS.
