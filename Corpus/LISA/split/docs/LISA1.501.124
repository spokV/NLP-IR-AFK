A STUDY OF THE PROBLEMS OF INFORMATION FLOWS IN SELECTED PHYSICOCHEMICAL
PROBLEM AREAS.
     
DETERMINES VOLUMES OF DOCUMENT FLOW IN SELECTED PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROBLEM AREAS
AND THE PATTERN OF DISTRIBUTION OF SERIAL AND PERIODICAL ARTICLES. BOTH
PARAMETERS ARE SHOWN TO VARY WITH TIME AND PROBLEM. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES
ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE SUBJECT ORIENTATION OF PUBLICATIONS GROUPED ACCORDING TO
THE BRADFORD 3-ZONE MODEL. SUGGESTS THAT TO DEVELOP REFERENCE/INFORMATION
COLLECTIONS IN SPECIFIC SUBJECT AREAS, ALL PUBLISHED SOURCES SHOULD BE
SEPARATED INTO 2 BROAD CATEGORIES-CORE PUBLICATIONS WITH RESPECT TO A GIVEN
THEME AND THE REST. DESCRIBES A METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING CORE PUBLICATIONS.
