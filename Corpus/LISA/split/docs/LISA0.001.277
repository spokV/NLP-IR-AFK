PROTECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL, LIBRARIES AND COMPUTERS.

THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISED IDENTIFICATION HAS ALARMED MANY PEOPLE IN
DENMARK AS ELSEWHERE. UNDER AN 1978 ACT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OFFICE HAS
ALREADY ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS ON CATALOGUING AND AUTHORS' ROYALTIES. THE MAIN
QUESTION CONCERNS THE LINKING OF BORROWER TO BOOK, THOUGH THIS WAS EQUALLY
POSSIBLE WITH OLDER ISSUE SYSTEMS. IN 2 RECENT CASES INVOLVING TERRORISM AND
MURDER, LIBRARIES HAVE RELUCTANTLY SUPPLIED POLICE WITH INFORMATION GENERALLY
REGARDED AS CONFIDENTIAL. THE LIBRARY OFFICE PROPOSES AN EXPLICIT STATEMENT OF
LIBRARIANS' DUTY TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY, ABD STRICTER CONTROL OF
OUT-OF-DATE PHOTOGRAPHIC ISSUE RECORDS. WHEN COMPUTER ISSUE SYSTEMS BECOME
COMMON, SUCH INFORMATION WILL BE MORE EASILY OBTAINED, AND THE DANISH LIBRARY
COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT IT SHOULD BE MADE IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACE A BORROWER
ONCE HIS BOOK IS RETURNED. WHILE THIS SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE 1978 ACT, ANY
FUTURE REVISION OF THE LIBRARY ACT SHOULD  STATE THE POSITION IN UNAMBIGUOUS
TERMS.
