SCANDINAVIAN COOPERATION IN THE LIBRARY FIELD: A CRITICAL EXAMINATION.

REFLECTIONS ON THE VALUE AND/OR NECESSITY OF PAN-SCANDINAVIAN LIBRARY
CONFERENCES, RECALLING THEIR PAST ACHIEVEMENTS IN ATTAINING COOPERATION
BETWEEN PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES, AND IN EXPRESSING AN INTANGIBLE BUT
DEFINITE SCANDINAVIAN UNITY. TODAY, WHILE SEVERAL SCANDINAVIAN ORGANISATIONS
ARE FORMALLY INVOLVED IN LIBRARY COOPERATION, THE CONFERENCES ACT AS CATALYSTS
FOR LATENT PROGRESS AND FRUITFUL DISCONTENT. THEY SHOULD REFLECT PROFESSIONAL
ACTIVITY SINCE THE LAST CONFERENCE, AND REVEAL ANY RESULTING COMMON
DENOMINATORS. THEIR MAIN FUNCTION WILL CONTINUE TO BE A MARKET-PLACE FOR
IDEAS, IN A SETTING ADAPTED TO THE ESTABLISHING AND DEVELOPING OF
PROFESSIONAL, SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
