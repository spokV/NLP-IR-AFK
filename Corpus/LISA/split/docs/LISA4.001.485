CONTINUING EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS THROUGH PRIVATE STUDY.
     
REPORT ON A 2-YEAR-SCHEME INTRODUCED BY THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARY IN RUSE,
TO ENCOURAGE CONTINUING EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS IN THE REGION THROUGH PRIVATE
STUDY. INITIALLY, 75 TOPICS WERE OFFERED, AND 94% OF FULL-TIME LIBRARIANS TOOK
PART IN THE SCHEME. EVEN PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS WITH 10, 15 AND MORE YEARS OF
SERVICE WERE NOT EXCLUDED FROM THEORETICAL, CONTROVERSIAL AND/OR INNOVATIVE
THEMES. THEY ALSO WIDELY EXPLORED SOVIET PERIODICALS AND LITERATURE IN
RUSSIAN. THE ATTITUDE AND RESPONSE OF BEGINNERS AND SOME LIBRARY ASSISTANTS
APPEARED TO BE LESS ENTERPRISING AND ENTHUSIASTIC, IN SOME CASES EVEN FORMAL.
IT IS HOPED, HOWEVER, THAT THEIR PROFESSIONAL ETHICS WILL IMPROVE IN FUTURE.
REGULAR MEETINGS WITH THEIR TUTORS, RESULTING IN THE INEVITABLE EXCHANGE OF
VIEWS AND OPINIONS WERE OF BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE IN THE STUDY. A POSITIVE
EVALUATION OF THE SCHEME MUST BE FOLLOWED BY FURTHER EXPERIMENTATION,
SEARCHING AND STRIVING FOR IMPROVE MENT.
