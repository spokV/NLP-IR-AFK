REGARDING CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE SCIENCES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATIONS.
     
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE CLASSIFICATIONS AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CLASSIFICATIONS HAS BEEN JUSTIFIED BY THE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER OF
KNOWLEDGE AND THE UNI-DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATION.
SEMANTIC CATALOGUES EXIST IN A LOGICAL STATE OF PROBABILITY NOT ONLY BECAUSE
OF THE TEMPORAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THEIR PREPARATION AND CONSULTATION, BUT
BECAUSE THEY CAN NEVER BE VERIFIED, EXCEPT AFTER A GREAT TIME LAG. THE PROBLEM
IS ALWAYS THE SEARCH FOR FORMULAE FOR REFERENCES PROVIDING THE GREATEST
GUARANTEE OF INTERCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN SUBJECTS. THERE IS A VITAL NEED TO
DEFINE THEORETICALLY AND LOGICALLY THE 'SUBJECT' IN RELATION TO THE 'OBJECT'.
