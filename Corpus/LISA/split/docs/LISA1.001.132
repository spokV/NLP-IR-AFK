IN SIGHT OUT: 'AM I MY BROTHER'S KEEPER?'.

PRESENTS AN ANNOTATED LIST OF PUBLICATIONS AIMED AT HELPING US CHURCHES
RESPOND TO THE AGED AND THE MENTALLY RETARDED/DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED.
SUGGESTS THAT THE LIBRARY COULD SUPPLY THIS INFORMATION TO LOCAL CHURCHES;
ACQUIRE THE PUBLICATIONS FOR THEIR OWN COLLECTIONS; AND READ THE MATERIAL TO
LEARN ABOUT PROVIDING SERVICES TO THESE PEOPLE. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE
PARISH IS THE DOOR TO PARTICIPATION FOR THE HANDICAPPED AND THAT THE PASTOR
MUST KEEP THE DOOR ALWAYS OPEN. COULDN'T 'LIBRARY' BE SUBSTITUTED FOR 'PARISH'
AND 'LIBRARIAN' FOR 'PASTOR'?.
