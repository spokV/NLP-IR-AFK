FACT RETRIEVAL FOR THE 1980S.
     
REVIEWS PREVAILING METHODOLOGIES OF FACT RETRIEVAL IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AND MAKES PROJECTIONS FOR THE DECADE TO COME' NUMERIC DATA BASES ARE SHOWN TO
OVERTAKE IN SIZE AND NUMBER THE LARGE BIBLIOGRAPHIC COLLECTIONS. THIS IS
EXPECTED TO LEAD TOWARD MORE SOPHISTICATED, INTERACTIVE DATA ANALYSIS
TECHNIQUES WITH GRAPHICAL DISPLAY OPTIONS. THE AVAILABILITY OF LOW-COST
INTELLIGENT COMPUTER TERMINALS, MICRO- AND MINICOMPUTERS, IS SHOWN TO MAKE
AGGREGATION AND POST-PROCESSING OF RETRIEVED INFORMATION FROM DIFFERENT
SOURCES READILY POSSIBLE. THIS CAPABILITY MAY COME INTO CONFLICT WITH LEGAL
CONSTRAINTS AND IS BOUND TO AFFECT THE TRADITIONAL MARKETING OF INFORMATION.
IT WILL LEAD TO THE EXTRACTION OF HIGHER FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE FROM TEXT AND
DATA. THE USER COMMUNITY IS SEEN TO SHIFT FROM EXPERT INFORMATION SPECIALISTS,
WHO ACT NOW AS MIDDLEMEN, TO THE END-USERS OF INFORMATION. THIS LESS
EXPERIENCED USER COMMUNITY WILL CHALLENGE THE INGENUITY OF SYSTEM DESIGNERS
FOR SELF-GUIDING, ADAPTIVE, AND YET MORE SOPHISTICATED MAN-MACHINE INTERFACES.
THE MERGING OF WIDE-BAND DIGITAL COMMUNICATION NETWORKS WITH COMPUTER
TECHNOLOGIES WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO INTERCONNECT COMPUTERS, INFORMATION
CENTRES, WORD PROCESSORS, AND OTHER PERIPHERALS, WORLDWIDE.
