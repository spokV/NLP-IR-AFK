METHODS FOR SETTING RENTAL AND DISCARD PRICES.

A RECENT REVIEW OF RENTAL COLLECTION ADMINISTRATION AT NEW ZEALAND'S HASTINGS
PUBLIC LIBRARY SHOWED THAT INCOME FROM RENTING BOOKS WAS NOT KEEPING PACE WITH
EXPENDITURE ON THE RENTAL COLLECTION. SUGGESTS A NEW METHOD FOR SETTING RENTAL
CHARGES (BASED ON RECOVERY OF PURCHASE PRICE IN 16 ISSUES) AND PRESENTS A
METHOD OF WORKING OUT THE DISCARD PRICE OF LIBRARY MATERIALS (ON THE BASIS
THAT THEY LOSE A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF THEIR VALUE WITH EACH CIRCULATION).
