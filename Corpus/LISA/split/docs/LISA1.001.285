THEORY OF CORRELATION TABLES. 1.

A POSSIBLE MATHEMATICAL MODEL IS PRESENTED FOR CORRELATION TABLES USED IN
SPECTROSCOPY. A PROCESS BASED ON INFORMATION THEORY IS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH AN
EXAMPLE FOR THE OPTIMUM CONSTRUCTION OF CORRELATION TABLES. IN THIS EXAMPLE
THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN NMR CORRELATION TABLE IS INVESTIGATED; THE METHOD IS
GENERAL AND IS SUITABLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CORRELATION TABLES USED IN
COMPUTERISED EVALUATION OF SPECTRA.
