DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES.

FOLLOWING A REVIEW OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF COMPUTERS AND MANAGERIAL
SCIENCE/OPERATIONS RESEARCH TO THE MANAGEMENT OF LIBRARIES, THIS PAPER
INTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. DSS, A BLENDING OF THESE
TECHNIQUES, CAN LEAD TO MORE EFFECTIVE DECISIONS BY LIBRARY MANAGERS. A CASE
STUDY OF THE UTILISATION OF A DSS IN THE BUDGETING PROCESS OF A MEDIUM SIZED
LIBRARY ILLUSTRATES THE PROCESS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
