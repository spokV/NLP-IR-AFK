VIDEO IN SWEDEN (PART 2).
     
COMMENTS ON THE SWEDISH VIDEO COMMISSION'S REPORT, PUBLISHED IN 1981. THE
REPORT DISCUSSES HOW VIDEO CAN BE USED TO STRENGTHEN FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.
QUALITY VIDEO FROM ABROAD MUST BE AVAILABLE. MINORITY GROUPS STAND TO BENEFIT
FROM VIDEO, AND DOMINATION BY COMMERCIAL PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MUST BE
OPPOSED. THE REPORT ASSIGNS A DECISIVE ROLE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS
DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, WITH 'VIDEOGRAPHERS', MEDIA WORKSHOPS AND MEDIA 'CAFES'
ATTACHED TO LOCAL LIBRARIES. IT PROPOSES STATE SUBSIDISED PRODUCTION WITH THE
SWEDISH EDUCATIONAL RADIO, THE SWEDISH TELEVISION, AND THE SWEDISH FILM
INSTITUTE, AMONG OTHERS, AS PRODUCERS. DISTRIBUTION THROUGH LIBRARIES MIGHT
TAKE 3 FORMS' SHOWING IN LIBRARIES, LOANS TO INDIVIDUALS AND SOCIETIES, VIA
CABLE TO HOMES AND INSTITUTIONS. FINANCING IS TO BE THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE 1ST
YEAR AND BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES THEREAFTER, WITH A POSSIBLE LENDING CHARGE.
THE REPORT'S THOROUGH SURVEY OF THE FIELD SHOULD PROVE USEFUL ALSO TO THE
OTHER NORDIC COUNTRIES. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSALS IS, HOWEVER, UNCERTAIN
OWING TO THE DIFFICULT FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. FOR PART 1,
2SEE1 THE PREVIOUS ABSTRACT.
