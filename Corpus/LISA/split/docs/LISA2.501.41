EVEN AFTER 8 YEARS WITHIN THE COLLEGES OF TECHNOLOGY, LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING
IS STILL A CRISIS AREA.
     
ALTHOUGH NATIONAL GUIDELINES WERE DRAWN UP ON LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING, EACH
WEST GERMAN STATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN EDUCATION SYSTEM, THEREFORE
CONSIDERABLE VARIATIONS STILL EXIST CONCERNING LEGAL STATUS OF LIBRARY
SCHOOLS, ENTRY REQUIREMENTS, CURRICULA FOR COMPULSORY AND OPTIONAL SUBJECTS
AND ORGANISATION OF COURSES FOR PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS. SOME SUBJECTS
ARE NOT TAUGHT AT ALL IN SOME SCHOOLS AND GENERALLY RELATED SUBJECTS ARE SPLIT
UP TOO MUCH. MANY LECTURERS PLACE TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON FORMAL LECTURES' MANY
STUDENTS ARE UNINTERESTED IN THEIR STUDIES. TRAINING COURSES MUST DEVELOP
STUDENTS' CRITICAL FACULTIES, ENCOURAGE CREATIVITY AND PROMOTE ACTIVE
COMMUNICATION WITH READERS AND COOPERATION WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS; BETTER
ORGANISATION AND MORE UNIFICATION AMONG LIBRARY SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED.
