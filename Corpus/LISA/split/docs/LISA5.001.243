EFFECTIVENESS AS INFORMATION SOURCES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. IN SEPARATE
INVESTIGATIONS THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS WERE STUDIED' (1) STRUCTURE, SIZE AND
INCREASE OF SOCIAL SCIENCES LITERATURE; (2) NATURE AND DEGREE OF COVERAGE AND
OVERLAP WITHIN THE SEPARATE DISCIPLINES AND AREAS OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES; (3)
DESIGN, EFFECTIVENESS AND USE OF SECONDARY SERVICES; AND (4) AN ANALYSIS OF
THE CONCENTRATION AND SCATTERING WITHIN THE SUBJECT AREAS, LANGUAGES, AND DATE
