LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION WORK' JOB CHARACTERISTICS AND STAFFING NEEDS.
     
RESULTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF A JOB-DESCRIPTION QUESTIONNAIRE TO MEMBERS OF
STAFF IN A REPRESENTATIVE 5% SAMPLE OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION UNITS ARE
REPORTED. THE FORM OF JOB DESCRIPTION, COVERING THE INTELLECTUAL, SOCIAL, AND
PHYSICAL DEMANDS OF THE WORK AND WORK ENVIRONMENT, ENABLES THE PERSONNEL
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE JOBS TO BE INFERRED FAIRLY DIRECTLY. AN ASSESSMENT IS
MADE OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH EXISTING PERSONNEL MEET THE DEMANDS OF THEIR JOBS.
THE WAY IN WHICH LIBRARY AND INFORMATION WORK IS CHANGING, AND THE ROLES OF
MEN AND WOMEN; AND OF GRADUATES ARE DISCUSSED. A JOB CLASSIFICATION BASED ON
CLUSTER ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES IS ALSO ATTEMPTED.
