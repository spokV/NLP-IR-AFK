PRESELECTING LITERATURE FOR ROUTINE DELIVERY TO PHYSICIANS IN A COMMUNITY
HOSPITAL-BASED PATIENT CARE RELATED READING PROGRAM.
     
REPORTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, OF PATIENT CARE RELATED
READING (PCRR), AN EXTENSION OF LITERATURE ATTACHED TO CHARTS (LATCH) AND
CLINICAL MEDICAL LIBRARIANSHIP (CML). PACKETS OF LITERATURE ON CERTAIN
CLINICAL DISORDERS ARE PREPARED BY THE HOSPITAL LIBRARIAN, REVIEWED BY
PHYSICIANS, AND AMENDED ACCORDINGLY BY THE LIBRARIAN WHO THEN DISTRIBUTES THEM
AS A ROUTINE PROCEDURE TO ALL PHYSICIANS CARING FOR PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS
CORRESPONDING TO A PREPARED TOPIC. PCRR REINFORCES THE CONCEPT OF THE
COMMUNITY HOSPITAL LIBRARY AS A SERVICE-ORIENTED ENTITY AND HELPS TO ESTABLISH
THE LIBRARY AS AN ACTIVE PARTNER IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF
HOSPITAL-BASED CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAMMES.
