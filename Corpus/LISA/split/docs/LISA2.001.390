INDEXES AS ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN THE INDEXED MATERIAL (IN
HEBREW).
     
EXAMINES INDEXES AS A SOURCE OF GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDEXED
MATERIAL. DEFINES THE CONCEPTS OF INDEX-ENTRY, INDEX-BASE AND INDEX AND
CONCLUDES THAT AN INDEX IS A GROUP OF DATA AND SUBJECTS WHICH THE INDEXER
DEEMED SIGNIFICANT AND AS EXPRESSING THE CONTENT OF THE INDEXED MATERIAL.
GIVEN AN IDEAL INDEXER, THE SIZE OF AN INDEX MAY SERVE AS A MEASUREMENT OF THE
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN THE INDEXING-BASE. SINCE PERFECT INDEXES DO NOT
EXIST, A CAREFUL EVALUATION OF A CONCORDANCE BY VOCABULARY SIZE AND WORD
OCCURRENCE COULD PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE. EVALUATION MUST BE DONE VERY CAREFULLY
IN RELATION TO CONTENT, DISCIPLINE AND TYPE OF INDEXED TERMS.
