SERIAL COST EFFICIENCY-A MODEL AND CASE STUDY (IN HEBREW).
     
HIGH RATE INFLATION IN PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION PRICES WITHOUT ADEQUATE BUDGET
INCREMENTS FORCE MANY LIBRARIES TO FREEZE NEW SUBSCRIPTIONS AND IN MANY CASES
TO CANCEL SUBSCRIPTIONS. THE PROCESS OF DESELECTION RAISES THE QUESTION OF
WHICH TITLES WILL BE RETAINED AND WHICH WILL BE DISCONTINUED. SUGGESTS THAT
THE EVALUATION OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE VARIOUS TITLES WILL BE DONE
BY USING A COST EFFICIENCY FORMULA. THE FORMULA COMBINES 2 FACTORS, THE PRICE
OF SUBSCRIPTION AND THE MEASURED USE OF THE JOURNAL, AND RANKS PERIODICALS IN
A GIVEN COLLECTION IN A DESCENDING ORDER' AT THE TOP WILL BE THE MOST
COST-EFFICIENT TITLE AND AT THE BOTTOM THE LEAST COST-EFFICIENT TITLE. THIS
FORMULA WAS TRIED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A USE STUDY OF THE JUDAICA READING
ROOM'S OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES DURING 1978.
