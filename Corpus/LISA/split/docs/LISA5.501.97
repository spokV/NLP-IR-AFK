THE RESOURCES AND SERVICES OF THE UPPSALA UNIVERSITY LIBRARY DURING THE
SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.

WHEN THE UNIVERSITY OF UPPSALA WAS RE-ESTABLISHED IN THE 1620S BY KING
GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS, A WELL-EQUIPPED UNIVERSITY LIBRARY WAS SEEN AS AN IMPORTANT
PRE-REQUISITE. THE LIBRARY WAS MOVED SEVERAL TIMES, AND IN 1638 A PERMANENT
POST OF LIBRARIAN WAS CREATED. THE BOOK COLLECTION WAS ARRANGED BY FACULTY,
AND SYSTEMATIC INDICES WERE PRODUCED. STUDENT WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BORROW BOOKS
FOR HOME READING, ALTHOUGH PROFESSORS COULD DO SO, AND PROFESSORS OFTEN STOOD
BAIL FOR THOSE WHO DEFAULTED ON THE RESTRICTIONS. LIBRARIANS WERE CHOSEN FROM
AMONGST THE UNIVERSITY'S MOST RENOWNED PROFESSORS. ULTIMATELY, CONSIDERABLE
CATALOGUING WORK WAS CARRIED OUT, FIXED HOURS WERE ESTABLISHED, AND THE
LIBRARY'S LENDING POLICY BECAME MORE LIBERAL.
