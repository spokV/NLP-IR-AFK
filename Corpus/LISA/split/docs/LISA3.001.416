ANTIOPE AND D.R.C.S.
     
THE DRCS SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN PRODUCING AN IMAGE FOR
VIDEOTEX OR TELETEXT. 3 MAIN AREAS OF APPLICATION ARE DISCUSSED. THE CHARACTER
SET FOR TEXT MATERIAL DIFFERS FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. FINE GRAPHICS (FOR
EXAMPLE MAPS) AND REPEATED SYMBOLS (FOR EXAMPLE ELECTRONIC SCHEMATICS) ARE
MADE POSSIBLE USING FEW CHARACTERS. THE PROBLEMS OF USING THE DRCS SYSTEM IN
ANTIOPE ARE DISCUSSED.
