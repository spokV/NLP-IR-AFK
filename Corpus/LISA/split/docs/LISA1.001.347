EFFECTIVENESS OF AUTOMATED INTERLIBRARY LOAN.

EXAMINES THE BORROWING PATTERNS OF 15 ACADEMIC MEMBERS OF THE SOUTH CENTRAL
RESEARCH LIBRARY COUNCIL (A MULTI-TYPE LIBRARY CONSORTIUM IN CENTRAL NEW YORK
STATE), THE EFFECTS OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE OCLC/ILL SUBSYSTEM ON THEIR
INTERLIBRARY LOAN PATTERNS, AND THE TRANSITION FROM THE USE OF NYSILL (NEW
YORK STATE INTERLIBRARY LOAN) TO USE OF OCLC/ILL. FINDS THAT OCLC/ILL HAS HAD
A MAJOR IMPACT-MATERIAL REQUESTED IS ARRIVING SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER, THE LOAD
ON MAJOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES HAS BEEN REDUCED, AND SMALLER LIBRARIES CAN NOW
SHARE THE LOAD IN FILLING INTERLIBRARY LOAN TRANSACTIONS. 25-50% OF REQUESTED
MONOGRAPHS ARE LESS THAN 5 YEARS OLD-PERHAPS IT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT TO
PURCHASE THEM. RETROSPECTIVE COLLECTION CONVERSION WOULD BE OF VALUE TO
INTERLIBRARY LOANS IF CARRIED OUT WITHIN THE NEXT 5 YEARS.
