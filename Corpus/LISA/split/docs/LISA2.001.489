PICTURE BOOKS: WHAT DO REVIEWS REALLY REVIEW?.
     
TO FIND OUT WHETHER REVIEWS OF PICTURE BOOKS REALLY REVIEW THE PICTURES, 50
REVIEWS PUBLISHED IN 1979 BY EACH OF 4 WIDELY-RESPECTED REVIEWING SOURCES ((1)
2HORNBOOK1, (2) 2BOOKLIST1, (3) 2SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL1, AND (4) 2BULLETIN OF
THE CENTER FOR CHILDREN'S BOOKS1) WERE SELECTED AT RANDOM. A COUNT WAS MADE OF
THE PROPORTION OF WORDS DESCRIBING THE ILLUSTRATIONS AND ALL FACTORS
CONTRIBUTING TO THE 'LOOK' OF A PICTURE BOOK. 70% OF REVIEWS IN (1), 82% IN
(2), 78% IN (3), AND 94% IN (4) DEVOTED 30% OR LESS OF THEIR WORDS TO VISUAL
QUALITIES. THESE RESULTS EXPOSE AN OMISSION IN THE REVIEWERS' RESPONSIBILITIES
AND A DISSERVICE TO READERS.
