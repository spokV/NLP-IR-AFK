MANAGING EXXON'S TECHNICAL REPORTS.

THE TECHNICAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EXXON REPORTS IS MANAGED BY USE OF AN
IN-HOUSE, COMPUTERISED SYSTEM THAT BUILDS A DATA BASE AND PRODUCES
CURRENT-AWARENESS 'REPORT ALERTS', VARIOUS INDEXES INCLUDING A SUBJECT KWIC,
AN ON-LINE DATA BASE, AND REPORTS-DISTRIBUTION CONTROL. KEY ELEMENTS IN THE
SYSTEM ARE: (1) A STRUCTURAL REPORT NUMBER THAT INCORPORATES CODES FOR THE
ISSUING UNIT, MAJOR SUBJECT, AND DATE; (2) NATURAL-LANGUAGE INDEXING SENTENCES
THAT MAKE UP A PSEUDO ABSTRACT; AND (3) CONTROLLED SUBJECT CATEGORIES THAT ARE
A BASE FOR THE 'REPORTS ALERTS' SYSTEM.
