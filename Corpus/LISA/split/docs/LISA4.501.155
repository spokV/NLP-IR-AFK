THE ART CENTRE, USED FOR THE FURNISHING OF HOSPITAL ROOMS.
     
HOSPITAL PATIENTS CAN OFTEN ONLY SEE BARE WALLS; CAREFULLY CHOSEN AND
ATTRACTIVE PICTURES HELP TO PROVIDE A CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT AND ASSIST IN
CONVALESCENCE. IN COOPERATION WITH THE ART CENTRE AT WEIMAR PUBLIC LIBRARY,
WEIMAR HOSPITAL BORROWS PICTURES FOR LONG-TERM LOAN, DISCUSSING REQUIREMENTS
WITH PATIENTS AND HOSPITAL STAFF. 2 YEARS' EXPERIENCE HAS REVEALED THAT'
PICTURES IN ROOMS AND CORRIDORS MAKE THE HOSPITAL SEEM MORE ATTRACTIVE;
PICTURES FOR BED-RIDDEN PATIENTS SHOULD BE LARGE AND CLEARLY VISIBLE, WITH
COLOURS AND SUBJECTS THAT STIMULATE RATHER THAN EXCITE, LANDSCAPES BEING
ESPECIALLY POPULAR; SOME PATIENTS WILL BUY A COPY OF ONE OF THESE PICTURES FOR
THEMSELVES WHEN THEY GO HOME; AND MEN AND WOMEN OFTEN ENJOY THE SAME PICTURES.
