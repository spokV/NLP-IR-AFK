AN APPROACH TO THE POTENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING.

FOLLOWING A PREVIOUS STUDY CONCERNED WITH THE MONITORING OF INFORMATION FLOW,
AIMS TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF INFORMATION IN THE PROSECUTION OF
ENGINEERING PROJECTS. FOR EACH OF 3 PROJECTS THE BACKGROUND OF POTENTIALLY
USEFUL INFORMATION WAS EXPLORED AND COMPARED WITH THE INFORMATION ACTUALLY
BEING USED. IN GENERAL NO VAST AMOUNT OF IMMEDIATELY USEFUL INFORMATION WAS
FOUND, MUCH OF THE INFORMATION USED DERIVING FROM THE INDIVIDUAL ENGINEER'S
OWN TRAINING AND RESOURCES. THE INFORMATION FLOW WAS REGARDED AS ADEQUATE FOR
THE PRACTICAL PURPOSES OF THE PROJECTS. HOWEVER, AWARENESS OF RESEARCH
INFORMATION POTENTIALLY USEFUL FOR THE LONG RANGE PLANNING WAS LIMITED, THE
MAIN OBSTACLES TO INFORMATION FLOW OF THIS TYPE BEING MANAGEMENT ATTITUDES AND
ORGANISATIONAL CONSTRAINTS.
