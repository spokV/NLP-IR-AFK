INFORMATION EDUCATION OF PUPILS AND THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER.

THE 'INFORMATION EDUCATION' OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IS NOT JUST THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF LIBRARIANS, BUT IT SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE MODERN TEACHING
PROCESS IN EVERY SUBJECT. SCHOOL LIBRARIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY OPERATED ON A
RUDIMENTARY LEVEL AS BOOKSTOCKS WITH LENDING OUTLETS-MOSTLY SUPPLYING
LITERATURE RELEVANT TO THE TEACHING OF THE MOTHER TONGUE. THIS IS NO LONGER
ADEQUATE AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES MUST BE TRANSFORMED INTO UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION
AND STUDY CENTRES. THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF EDUCATION HAS ISSUED A DIRECTIVE NO
3767/1979 WHICH ENVISAGES SCHOOL LIBRARIES FULFILLING 3 ROLES' SUPPLYING
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION MATERIAL TO BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS; CONTRIBUTING TO
THE UPBRINGING OF THE NEW SOCIALIST GENERATION THROUGH WORKING WITH BOOKS;
EDUCATING BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS TO USE INFORMATION SOURCES INDEPENDENTLY
DURING INDIVIDUAL STUDY, CAREER SELECTION AND LEISURE. ACQUISITION MUST PLACE
GREATER EMPHASIS ON SCIENTIFIC, TE CHNICAL AND OTHER SUBJECT ORIENTED BOOKS.
