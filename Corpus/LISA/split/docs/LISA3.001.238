RESEARCH INTO WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIES CAN BEST PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION.
     
THE 1ST STAGE OF RESEARCH HAS BEEN THE DEFINITION OF THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES
WITHIN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION NETWORK. FROM THERE, STUDY HAS CONTINUED ON
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LONGTERM DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION NEEDS AND
CURRENT INFORMATION WORK IN LIBRARIES. INFORMATION NEEDS CAN BE DIFFERENTIATED
ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY CAN BEST BE SATISFIED BY AUTOMATED SEARCH SYSTEMS,
OR BY TRADITIONAL METHODS. A 3RD GROUP CAN BEST BE SATISFIED THROUGH INFORMAL
CHANNELS. ALL THESE PROCEDURES CAN BE EVALUATED IN THE EVERYDAY WORK OF A
LIBRARY AND COMPARISON BETWEEN PRACTICE IN THE USSR AND THE USA IS
INSTRUCTIVE.
