DISCUSSION AND COMMUNICATION FOR STAFF IN THE HOOGEVEEN PUBLIC LIBRARY.

IN 1971 A SCHEME OF WORKER PARTICIPATION WAS INTRODUCED AT HOOGEVEEN PUBLIC
LIBRARY IN THE NETHERLANDS. PREVIOUSLY STAFF MEETINGS WERE RESTRICTED TO
ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF ONLY. UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM WEEKLY MEETINGS WERE HELD AT
WHICH THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN AND HEADS OF THE ADULT AND CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENTS
WERE PRESENT. REPORTS OF THESE MEETINGS WERE CIRCULATED TO ALL HEADS OF
DEPARTMENTS. IN 1975 FOLLOWING THE OPENING OF A NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY THE
LIBRARY SERVICE WAS REORGANISED INTO 8 DEPARTMENTS AND A NEW STRUCTURE OF
STAFF MEETINGS WAS INTRODUCED. IN ADDITION TO THE MEETINGS ATTENDED BY
ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF AND HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS, ALL STAFF OF THE INTERNAL
SERVICES MEET EVERY 3 WEEKS, WHILE STAFF OF THE EXTERNAL SERVICES MEET EACH
WEEK. THE PURPOSE OF THESE MEETINGS IS TO IMPROVE STAFF MOTIVATION AND THEREBY
THE QUALITY OF THE LIBRARY'S SERVICES.
