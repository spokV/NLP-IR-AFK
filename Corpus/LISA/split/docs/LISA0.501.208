PROBLEMS OF LIBRARY LIGHTING.

INDICATES THAT THERE IS NO CERTAIN FORMULA FOR THE OPTIMISATION OF LIBRARY
LIGHTING, AND EXPERTS DIFFER IN THEIR OPINIONS ON THE BEST LIGHTING. FOR MANY
YEARS 'THE MORE, THE BETTER' WAS THE PHILOSOPHY OF LIGHTING DESIGN, BUT THE
EFFECT CAN BE UNIFORM, MONOTONOUS, COLD AND RATHER SOULLESS. DISCUSSES THE
PROS AND CONS OF USING DAYLIGHT AND ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING, AS WELL AS THE
BIOLOGICAL NEEDS FOR DAYLIGHT. PROPOSES A NEW CONCEPT OF LIGHTING DESIGN,
BASED ON VISUAL TASKS AND BIOLOGICAL NEEDS, WHICH SHOULD BE ENTERED IN THE
BUILDING PROGRAMME, TO ENABLE THE ARCHITECT TO EMPLOY THE BEST LIGHTING FOR
VISUAL TASKS, THE INTERNAL APPEARANCE OF THE LIBRARY AND THE WELL-BEING OF ITS
READERS.
