WHY STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES?.
     
THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THE GROWTH AND SPREAD IN THE USE OF ON-LINE
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN LESS DRAMATIC THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN
EXPECTED. ONE OF THE OBSTACLES FACING THE USER IS THE NEED TO MASTER MANY
DIVERSE USER INTERFACES. SEVERAL SOLUTIONS ARE OFFERED, YET, THE ONLY ONE
WHICH IS REALLY OPEN AT PRESENT IS TO DECLINE TO USE ALL BUT 1 OR 2 FAMILIAR
SYSTEMS, ACCEPTING THAT SOME POTENTIALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION WILL BE MISSED.
THE MAIN ALTERNATIVES SEEM TO BE THE ADOPTION OF STANDARDS BY SYSTEM OPERATORS
OR THE USE OF TRANSLATING SOFTWARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE USER AND THE
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. WITH THE ADVENT OF THE MICROPROCESSOR AND THE INTELLIGENT
TERMINAL, THIS LATTER ALTERNATIVE BECOMES MORE ATTRACTIVE AND IT MAY APPEAR,
AT 1ST SIGHT, THAT THE NEED FOR STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES IS THEREFORE
LESSENED, OR EVEN DISAPPEARS TOTALLY. HOWEVER, CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE
POSSIBILITIES OFFERED LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ADOPTI ON OF STANDARDS
WILL BE MORE RATHER THAN LESS IMPORTANT IF MUCH OF THE POTENTIAL IS TO BE
REALISED.
