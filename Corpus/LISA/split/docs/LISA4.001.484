QUALIFICATION OF LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS.
     
HAVING MENTIONED BRIEFLY THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARIES TO SOCIETY, AND ALSO
COURSES OFFERED FOR PROSPECTIVE NON-GRADUATE AND GRADUATE LIBRARIANS AND
INFORMATION SCIENTISTS IN SLOVAKIA, DISCUSSES CONTINUING EDUCATION AND
IN-SERVICE TRAINING OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTRE STAFF. SINCE 1976, THE
SAID CONCEPT HAS ENJOYED OFFICIAL BACKING BY REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE SLOVAK
MINISTRY OF CULTURE. THE REGULATIONS ARE BINDING ON ALL CENTRAL AND OTHER
MAJOR LIBRARIES. SO FAR, THE MOST IMPORTANT TRAINING PROJECTS HAVE BEEN
LAUNCHED BY MATICA SLOVENSKA AND BY THE SLOVAK TECHNICAL LIBRARY. IN-SERVICE
COURSES SHOULD NOT ONLY INCLUDE LECTURES, BUT ALSO WORK IN SEMINARS AND
SMALLER GROUPS. VISITS TO SELECTED LIBRARIES AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR STAFF
STIMULATE THE EXCHANGE OF VIEWS AND IDEAS. FILMS AND OTHER ILLUSTRATIVE
MATERIALS MUST BE USED MORE FULLY. GRADUATES, CONTINUING THEIR STUDIES ABROAD,
MUST BE ENCOURAGED TO CONCENTRATE ON TOPICAL PROBLE MS, AND TO AIM AT POSTS
WITH RESPONSIBILITY. USERS OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES HAVE TO BE
EDUCATED AND TRAINED, TOO, TO MAKE THE BEST OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE.
STARTING WITH UNDERGRADUATES, THE SCHEME MUST BE EXPANDED TO INVOLVE THE WHOLE
NATION IN FUTURE.
