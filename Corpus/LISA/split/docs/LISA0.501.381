A FEW PRACTICAL REMARKS ON THE USER-FRIENDLINESS OF ONLINE SYSTEMS.

A LIST OF GENERAL PROPERTIES OF A USER-FRIENDLY ON-LINE SYSTEM IS PRESENTED.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE REQUIREMENTS OF EXPERIENCED USERS ON THE ONE HAND, AND OF
THE BEGINNERS OR INCIDENTAL USERS ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE CONTRADICTORY.
SYNONYMOUS COMMANDS, LESS STRICTLY FORMALISED INPUT DATA TRANSFORMED TO
STANDARDISED FORMATS BY INTELLIGENT INPUT PROGRAMS, EXPLICIT AS WELL AS
IMPLICIT INPUT DATA, FREE CHOICE BETWEEN DEFAULT OR USER'S OWN PARAMETERS AND
PROCEDURES OR MACROCOMMANDS, CAN MAKE ANY SYSTEM MORE FRIENDLY EVEN FOR
HETEROGENEOUS USER POPULATION.
