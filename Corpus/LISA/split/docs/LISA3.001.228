ACCESS TO LOCAL-GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTATION.
     
DESCRIBES THE 'ACCESS TO LOCAL-GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTATION' PROJECT CARRIED OUT
BY CAPITAL PLANNING INFORMATION IN 1979-80. THE PROJECT HAD ITS ORIGINS IN THE
PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY THOSE REQUIRING ACCESS TO THE INCREASING NUMBER AND
RANGE OF DOCUMENTS PRODUCED BY UK LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THE PROJECT TEAM
IDENTIFIED THE DOCUMENTARY OUTPUT OF 5 LOCAL AUTHORITIES; INVESTIGATED
BIBLIOGRAPHIC STANDARDS, AUTHORITY ATTITUDES TOWARDS PUBLISHING AND
AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS; AND MEASURED THE AVAILABILITY OF THE DOCUMENTS.
