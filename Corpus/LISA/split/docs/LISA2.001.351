EXAMINATION OF WASTAGE AND PROTECTION AGAINST THEFT; EXPERIENCES FROM
GOTHENBURG CITY LIBRARY.
     
WHEN GOTHENBURG CITY LIBRARY INTRODUCED BUMS, (BIBLIOTEKSTJANST UTLANINGS OCH
MEDIAKONTROLL SYSTEM) WHICH NECESSITATED A TOTAL STOCKTAKING OF THE BOOKS
LISTED IN THE CARD CATALOGUE, IT WAS FOUND THAT 25% OF THE STOCK WAS MISSING.
SPOT CHECKS AFTER BUMS WAS ESTABLISHED SHOWED LOSSES OF 4% ANNUALLY, OR 10,000
VOLUMES. INTRODUCTION OF A THEFT PREVENTION SYSTEM WAS COMBINED WITH A NEW
COMPUTER CHECK-OUT SYSTEM. AFTER STUDY VISITS, THE CHECKPOINT BY-PASS SYSTEM
WAS FOUND MOST SUITABLE FOR A PUBLIC LIBRARY OF GOTHENBURG'S SIZE. A METAL
STRIP IS EMBEDDED IN THE BOOK WHICH RELEASES A SOUND SIGNAL IF THE BOOK IS
TAKEN OUT UNREGISTERED. AFTER SOME TEETHING TROUBLES THE SYSTEM IS WORKING
WELL AND THE STAFF HANDLE GUILTY BORROWERS WITHOUT DIFFICULTY. IT IS HOPED TO
OBTAIN 80% SECURITY.
