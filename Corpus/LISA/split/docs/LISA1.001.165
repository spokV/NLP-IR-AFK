AN EVALUATIVE, HOLISTIC, AND USER-ORIENTED APPROACH TO ASSESSING AND
MONITORING EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY IN ITS SETTING.

DESCRIBES RESEARCH UNDERTAKEN TO BROADEN THE THEORETICAL BASE ON WHICH
EFFECTIVENESS OF LIBRARY SERVICES CAN BE DETERMINED, TO TRANSLATE FINDINGS
INTO OPERATIONAL TERMS, AND TO TEST OPERATIONALLY A SYSTEM OF ASSESSING AND
MONITORING EFFECTIVENESS ON THE BASIS OF THE FINDINGS. THE METHODOLOGY
DEVELOPED WAS CENTRED ON A LIBRARY USER QUESTIONNAIRE IN WHICH THE USERS WERE
ASKED TO RATE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE, LEVEL OF USER SATISFACTION, USER
BENEFIT, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF EACH LIBRARY SERVICE. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS
TESTED IN A COLLEGE, WITH PROMISING RESULTS. THIS LINE OF RESEARCH IS
CONTINUING.
