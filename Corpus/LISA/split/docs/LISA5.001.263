FROM THE NATIONAL DIET LIBRARY, TOKYO. 2. A PROPOSAL FOR A STANDARD COMMON
CORE CHARACTER SET (CCCS).

SHORTENED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED TO THE SECTION ON INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY, IFLA MANILA CONFERENCE, 1980. TO ATTAIN THE GOAL OF UNIVERSAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL, AN EAST ASIAN VERSION OF UNIMARC MUST BE DEVELOPED;
EACH COUNTRY USING CHINESE CHARACTERS MUST FORMULATE A STANDARDISED CHINESE
CHARACTER SET; AND CONVERSION TABLES MUST BE DEVISED TO ENABLE SUCH COUNTRIES
TO EXCHANGE MARC TAPES WITH MEANINGFUL RESULTS. A COMMON CORE CHARACTER SET
(COMPRISING CHINESE CHARACTERS HAVING THE SAME MEANING IN ALL THESE COUNTRIES)
COULD BE COMPILED. JAPAN'S NATIONAL DIET LIBRARY IS WILLING TO WORK ON THIS.
FOR PART 1, 2SEE1 82/5413.
