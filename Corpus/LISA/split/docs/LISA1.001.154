ASSESSING EFFECTIVENESS.

A PRELIMINARY STUDY TO PROBE THE VIEWS OF LIBRARIANS, RELATING TO THE ROLE OF
EVALUATION AND THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS. INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED IN A
10% SAMPLE OF LIBRARY AUTHORITIES IN ENGLAND IN SEPT 79-MAY 80. OPINIONS WERE
SOUGHT FROM CHIEF LIBRARIANS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OFFICERS AND SENIOR
MANAGEMENT. A WORKSHOP WAS SET UP TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE LEVELS OF
UNDERSTANDING OF AND COMMITMENT TO THE USE OF EVALUATIVE TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO
LIBRARY PERFORMANCE. 2 DETAILED CHECKLISTS RELATING TO EFFECTIVENESS AND
EVALUATIVE DESIGN WERE GENERATED AND USED AS A BASIS FOR THE WORK. THE NEED
FOR GUIDANCE ON TERMINOLOGY AND DIRECTION ON METHODS WAS CLEARLY ESTABLISHED
BUT WAS DEEMED LIKELY TO BE INEFFECTIVE IF IMPOSED BY AGENCIES EXTERNAL TO
LIBRARY SYSTEMS.
