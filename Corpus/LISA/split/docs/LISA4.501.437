AN EXAMINATION OF BOOK BUYERS AND LIBRARY USERS.
     
VERY FEW PEOPLE EITHER ONLY BUY THEIR BOOKS OR ONLY OBTAIN THEM FROM A LIBRARY
AND MANY PEOPLE BUY BOOKS AS OFTEN AS THEY BORROW THEM. LIBRARY USERS WHO
BORROW FEW BOOKS BUY A LARGER PROPORTION OF THEIR BOOKS THAN LIBRARY USERS WHO
BORROW MANY BOOKS. HOWEVER, WHEREAS OVER 1/2 THE POPULATION OF GERMANY BUY
BOOKS, ONLY ABOUT 1/4 USE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE REVEALED THAT
IMPORTANT INFLUENCES ON BEHAVIOUR REGARDING THE USE OF BOOKS INCLUDE THE HOME
BACKGROUND, SCHOOL AND GENERAL SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. AN INDIVIDUAL'S SENSE OF
VALUES ALSO PLAYS ITS PART, OFTEN INFLUENCED BY THE MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION
POSSIBILITIES. PERHAPS THE MAIN INFLUENCE IS THE SOCIAL LEARNING PROCESS AND
AN INDIVIDUAL'S OWN ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT. THERE ARE STILL NUMEROUS UNEXPLORED
POSSIBILITIES FOR INFLUENCING CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN THEIR USE OF BOOKS.
