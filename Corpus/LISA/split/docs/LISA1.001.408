PROBLEMS OF DOCUMENT DELIVERY FOR THE EURONET USER.

A FRANKLIN INSTITUTE GMBH, MUNICH, TECHNICAL REPORT PREPARED FOR THE
COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES DIRECTORATE GENERAL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT. ITS PURPOSE WAS TO THROW
LIGHT ON THE REQUIREMENTS, PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS CONCERNING DOCUMENT
ORDERING AND DELIVERY THROUGH EURONET/DIANE. MANY CLASSES OF INDIVIDUAL AND
ORGANISATION WERE INTERVIEWED, REVEALING A LEVEL OF DEMAND OF 6 MILLION
DOCUMENTS ANNUALLY WHICH IS INCREASING AT A RATE OF 4-10% PER YEAR. EURONET
ON-LINE SEARCHING COULD HAVE A DRAMATIC EFFECT ON THESE FIGURES, ACCOUNTING
FOR 50% OF THE INCREASE IN DEMAND. PRESENT DOCUMENT SUPPLY CENTRES APPEAR TO
BE OPERATING AT CAPACITY AND AS AUTOMATED ORDERING SERVICE COULD BE HIGHLY
BENEFICIAL.
