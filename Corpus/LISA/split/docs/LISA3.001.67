THE BRITISH LIBRARY' PHENOMENON OF THE SEVENTIES OR PROTOTYPE OF NATIONAL
LIBRARY PLANNING.
     
IN ITS LEGISLATION, THE COMPOSITION AND POWERS OF ITS BOARD, AND ITS
UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF A NATIONAL LIBRARY IN THE
70S AND BEYOND, THE BRITISH LIBRARY MIGHT JUSTIFIABLY BE DEEMED A PROTOTYPE OF
MODERN NATIONAL LIBRARY PLANNING; BUT SINCE IT BEGAN FROM A VANTAGE POINT NOT
ACCESSIBLE TO OTHER EXISTING NATIONAL LIBRARIES IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
(AND BEYOND THE REACH OF THOSE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES), IT MAY BE VIEWED
RATHER AS A PHENOMENON OF THE 70S.
