MANAGEMENT PRACTICE, WITH REFERENCE TO THE ELABORATION OF OFFICIAL NORMS AND
REGULATIONS FOR USE, STATISTICAL EVIDENCE OF THE EXPANSION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC
SERVICE IS GIVEN, SHOWING PROGRESSIVE INCREASE IN WORKSHOP SPACE, SPECIALIST
PERSONNEL EMPLOYED, AND MICROFILM FOOTAGE PRODUCTION, WITH REFERENCE TO
RELEVANT STATE PUBLICATIONS. THE RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMME OF DUPLICATING
IMPORTANT HOLDINGS IS BRIEFLY DESCRIBED, AND COMMENTS MADE ON ATTITUDES IN
GENERAL TO USE OF MICROFILM, POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE. CONCLUDES THAT TO MAINTAIN
