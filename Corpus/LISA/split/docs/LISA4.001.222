THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY TECHNICIAN.
     
A DISCUSSION OF THE PRESENT SITUATION IN QUEBEC BY A DOCUMENTATION TECHNOLOGY
WORKER. THE AVAILABLE TRAINING COURSES ARE OUTLINED, AND THE DISTINCTIONS
BETWEEN TECHNICIANS AND LIBRARIANS IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE, WITH REFERENCE
TO TRAINING, RESPONSIBILITIES AND STATUS, DEFINED. THE TECHNICIAN'S MAIN
PROBLEMS, LACK OF RECOGNITION BY EMPLOYERS AND OPPOSITION FROM OTHER
CATEGORIES OF STAFF, ARE CONSIDERED, AND IN CONCLUSION, PREDICTS THAT THE
PRESENT DRAWBACKS WILL DIMINISH AS THE USE OF LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY INCREASES.
