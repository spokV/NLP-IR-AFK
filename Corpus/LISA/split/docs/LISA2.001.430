BRITISH VIDEOTEX EXPERIENCE GIVES HINT OF FUTURE.
     
UK EXPERIENCE WITH VIEWDATA AND TELETEXT, OR INTERACTIVE AND BROADCAST
VIDEOTEX, IS CONSIDERED AND ITS DISAPPOINTING PROGRESS SINCE IT WAS INVENTED
NEARLY 10 YEARS AGO IS DISCUSSED. ALTHOUGH THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN SLOW TO ADOPT
BRITISH TELECOM'S PRESTEL, SOME BUSINESSES, SUCH AS TRAVEL AGENCIES AND REAL
ESTATE FIRMS ARE FINDING THE INTERACTIVE SYSTEM ATTRACTIVE. THE QUESTION OF
HOW TO DEFINE WHAT IS NEWS AND WHAT IS ADVERTISING IS DISCUSSED AND THE
EXPLOITATION BY NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS OF THE MEDIUM'S COMMERCIAL POSSIBILITIES
IS OUTLINED, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE APPROACH OF TELEMAP, THE
VIDEOTEX SUBSIDIARY OF THE EAST MIDLAND ALLIED PRESS. FINALLY, THE LONGTERM
RISKS TO TELECOM FROM ITS LIMITED ROLE AS A CARRIER RATHER THAN AN INFORMATION
PROVIDER ARE CONSIDERED.
