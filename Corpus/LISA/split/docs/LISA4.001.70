SOME COMMENTS ON THE CURRICULUM OF THE BASIC BRANCH OF STUDY-LIBRARY SCIENCE,
INTRAMURAL STUDY.
     
THE INTRAMURAL COURSE OF STUDY AT THE HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY IN BERLIN LEADING TO
A DEGREE IN LIBRARY SCIENCE PROVIDES FUTURE LIBRARIANS WITH SCIENTIFICALLY
BASED KNOWLEDGE AND GOOD PRACTICAL CAREER TRAINING. A STUDENT FOLLOWS COURSES
IN SUBJECTS RELATED TO LIBRARY SCIENCE, MARXISM AND LENINISM, AND FOREIGN
LANGUAGES, RUSSIAN, ENGLISH AND FRENCH. SEVERAL PRACTICAL WORK PERIODS SPENT
IN DIFFERENT PUBLIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES MAKE UP PART OF THE COURSE.
LIBRARIAN STUDENTS ALSO ATTEND COURSES IN SUBJECTS SUCH AS INFORMATION
SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND MODERN MEDIA TO ENABLE THEM TO FOLLOW FUTURE
DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE FIELDS AFFECTING THE LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE COURSE OF STUDY
LASTS 8 TERMS, THE LAST OF WHICH IS SPENT IN A LIBRARY DOING PRACTICAL WORK
AND RESEARCHING FOR A THESIS FOR THE FINAL EXAMINATION. THE TITLE AWARDED TO
LIBRARIANS ON PASSING THE FINALS IS DIPLOMBIBLIOTHEKAR (DIPLOMA LIBRARIAN).
THE CO URSE ALSO TRIES TO STIMULATE STUDENTS TO INDEPENDENT STUDY WHILE AT
UNIVERSITY AND TO EXPAND THEIR KNOWLEDGE CONTINUOUSLY IN THEIR FUTURE CAREERS.
