ACCESS TO FEDERAL DOCUMENTS IN SMALL NON-DEPOSITORY ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.

50 SMALL ACADEMIC LIBRARIES NOT HOUSING FEDERAL DEPOSITORIES WERE SURVEYED TO
DETERMINE HOW WELL THEY CAN MEET USERS' NEEDS FOR FEDERAL DOCUMENTS. RESULTS
INDICATE THESE LIBRARIES SPEND AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT $750 A YEAR ON DOCUMENTS,
ACQUIRE VERY LITTLE FREE MATERIAL, AND INCORPORATE MOST DOCUMENTS INTO THE
REGULAR COLLECTION OR THE VERTICAL FILE. ALTHOUGH MOST ACQUIRE THE BASIC
DOCUMENT REFERENCE SOURCES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC TOOLS, VERY FEW MAKE ANY
SIGNIFICANT USE OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN. APPARENTLY MOST CANNOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO
DOCUMENTS EQUAL TO THAT OFFERED BY EVEN SMALL DEPOSITORIES.
