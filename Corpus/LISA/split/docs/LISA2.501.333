REVIEWING SLIDES FOR LIBRARY USE.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS A LIBRARIAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SLIDE SERIES
FOR HIS LIBRARY MAY RELY FOR HIS SELECTION ON REVIEWS IN THE PROFESSIONAL
LITERATURE OR ON THE RECOMMENDED COLLECTIONS OF THE NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN
LECTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE). THE LIBRARIAN
SHOULD ALSO EXAMINE THE TECHNICAL QUALITY OF THE SLIDE, INCLUDING THE
SHARPNESS OF THE IMAGE AND THE ACCURACY OF THE COLOURS. IN ADDITION HE SHOULD
EXAMINE THE WAY IN WHICH INFORMATION IS PRESENTED IN THE SLIDES AND THE
ACCOMPANYING TEXT. A SERIES OF APPARENTLY UNCONNECTED IMAGES LEAVES THE VIEWER
BORED. AT PRESENT TOO MANY SLIDE SERIES ARE OF POOR QUALITY AND LIBRARIANS
MUST BE PREPARED TO COMPLAIN TO MANUFACTURERS IN ORDER TO RECTIFY THIS
SITUATION.
