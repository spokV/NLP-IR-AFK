GEAC IN ACTION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HULL.

THE GEAC TERMINALS AT HULL UNIVERSITY ARE STANDARD, COMPRISING KEYBOARD, VDU
AND LIGHTPEN AND THE SYSTEM IS RUN ON A GEAC 8000 MINI. FILES ARE STORED ON
2X300 MEGABYTE DISCS. SINCE HULL HAD NO EXISTING MACHINE-READABLE CATALOGUE, A
FULL RECORD OF ALL STOCK HAD TO BE COMPILED. THE AUTOMATED CIRCULATION CONTROL
SYSTEM AT PRESENT OPERATES ONLY ON A SMALL SECTION OF THE STOCK, BUT IT IS
HOPED TO EXTEND THIS TO ALL CLASSES. ECONOMIC STRINGENCY OBLIGED HULL TO
DISCARD ITS FLEXIBLE AND EFFECTIVE MANUAL SYSTEM AND REPLACE IT WITH AN
EFFICIENT AND EASILY-USED SYSTEM. GEAC FULFILLED THE UNIVERSITY'S NEEDS, AND
THE PARTIAL SYSTEM OPERATING AT PRESENT MEETS HULL'S REQUIREMENTS.
