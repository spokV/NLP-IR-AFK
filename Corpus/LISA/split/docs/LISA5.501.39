RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.

OWING TO GOVERNMENT ECONOMY MEASURES THE DOCUMENTALISTS' TRAINING SCHOOL MUST
CLOSE BY 1893 AND THE PLANNED COURSE ON INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION IN
DARMSTADT MAY NOT AFTER ALL BEGIN IN 1982, WHICH POSES A REAL THREAT TO ALL
BASIC AND ADVANCED TRAINING COURSES. THERE IS STILL DISPUTE OVER THE VALUE OF
INTEGRATED TRAINING COURSES FOR LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTALISTS AND AS TO
WHETHER DOCUMENTALISTS SHOULD HAVE DEGREE STATUS. INFORMATION SCIENTISTS ARE
THE VITAL LINK BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND INFORMATION PRODUCED BY AN EVER WIDENING
RANGE OF TECHNOLOGICAL PRODUCTS. A UNIFIED TRAINING SYSTEM WITH GOOD PROMOTION
PROSPECTS MUST BE ESTABLISHED WITH DEGREE QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE HIGHEST STAFF
GRADES. THE TRANSITION PERIOD RESULTING AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW
SYSTEM WILL DEMAND FURTHER TRAINING AFTER A BASIC QUALIFICATION HAS BEEN
OBTAINED.
