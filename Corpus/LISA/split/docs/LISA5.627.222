SELECTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL MATERIALS AND ACQUISITION POLICY' GENERAL
PROBLEMS.

DISCUSSES THE SITUATION IN LATIN AMERICA'S UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. EXAMINES THE STATE OF EDUCATION

USING THE ADVICE OF SPECIALISTS, AND DISREGARDING RESTRICTIONS OF RESOURCES BY
AUTHORITIES UNAPPRECIATIVE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARIES IN PROMOTING CULTURE
AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE.
