FACING THE PUBLIC.

PONDERS ON THE JOINT PROMOTIONS OFFERED BY THE MCDONALD'S FAST-FOOD CHAIN AND
THE US PUBLIC LIBRARY, SUGGESTING THAT THE FORMER POSSESSES ALL THE ATTRIBUTES
THAT THE LATTER HANKERS AFTER. LIBRARIANS HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR NICE,
CLEAN-CUT, DEFINABLE, EASILY-RETRIEVABLE QUESTIONS. UNLIKE FAST-FOOD CHAINS,
HOWEVER, THE LIBRARY HAS A MANDATE TO SERVE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND INDIVIDUAL
NEEDS. OTHERWISE THERE IS NO NEED FOR IT TO EXIST, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF
FAST-FOOD ITEMS (SUCH AS PAPERBACKS AND ROCK RECORDS) THAT IT CIRCULATES.
