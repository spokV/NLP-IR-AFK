ONLINE DATA SEARCHING AS A TOOL FOR MOTIVATING INNOVATION.
     
A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO TEST THE CONTENTION; WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY A REVIEW
OF THE LITERATURE THAT ACCESS TO A WIDE VARIETY OF IDEAS AND NOVELTY WILL TEND
TO STIMULATE INNOVATION. THE EXPERIMENT CONSISTED OF A STUDY OF ATTITUDE
CHANGES THROUGH PRE- AND POST-TEST ADMINISTRATION OF A RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE
TO A GROUP OF 20 VOLUNTARY PARTICIPANTS FROM A SMALL HIGH TECHNOLOGY COMPANY
BEFORE AND AFTER A 60-DAY PERIOD OF EXPOSURE TO ON-LINE SEARCHING. EVALUATION
USING STANDARD STATISTICAL TESTS INDICATED THAT A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT
INCREASE IN PERCEIVED LEVEL OF INNOVATION OCCURRED AFTER THE SUBJECT'S
EXPOSURE TO ON-LINE DATA SEARCHING. IN ADDITION, A DIRECT AND POSITIVE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PERCEIVED LEVEL OF NEW IDEA GENERATION AND THE
FREQUENCY OF ON-LINE SEARCHING WAS OBSERVED. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
