AN ASSOCIATIVE FILE STORE USING FRAGMENTS FOR RUN-TIME INDEXING AND
COMPRESSION.
     
AN ASSOCIATIVE FILE STORE (AFS) IS OFFERED AS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO CURRENT
PROBLEMS WITH ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. IT WOULD BE A
SINGLE-INSTRUCTION MULTIPLE-DATA STREAM MACHINE, DEDICATED TO ASSOCIATIVE FILE
SEARCHING WHILE OVERALL CONTROL OF THE SYSTEM WOULD BE ENTRUSTED TO A
CONVENTIONAL SINGLE-INSTRUCTION SINGLE-DATA STREAM MACHINE. THE ASSOCIATIVE
PARALLEL PROCESSOR (A MAJOR COMPONENT OF AFS) WOULD SUPPORT 'ON-THE-FLY' FILE
SEARCHING AND SIMPLIFY THE INDEXING PROBLEMS OF DIRECTLY ACCESSING SINGLE
RECORDS TO THAT OF INDICATING THE MOST PROBABLE SCAN BLOCK FOR A HIGH RECALL
OF MATCHING RECORDS. INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS SUGGEST THAT AFS WOULD OUT-PERFORM
CONVENTIONAL FILE STORES BY OVER 2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, BE SIMPLE TO MAINTAIN,
AND OFFER FULL FREE-TEXT RETRIEVAL FLEXIBILITY.
