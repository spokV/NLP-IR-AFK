SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS IN BULGARIAN LIBRARIES.
     
AFTER THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTION IN BULGARIA IN 1944, ALMOST 62% OF PUBLIC
LIBRARIES WERE ALLOCATED LARGER PREMISES. 5 OF THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARIES,
ESTABLISHED AS SUCH IN 1953, MOVED INTO NEW BUILDINGS, WHILE 2 OTHER BUILDINGS
WERE ERECTED FOR LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION. IN SPITE OF THESE
IMPROVEMENTS, THERE IS STILL A CONSIDERABLE SHORTAGE OF SPACE IN LIBRARIES,
WHICH, IN GENERAL, ARE ALSO IN NEED OF MODERNISATION. REPROGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT,
COMPUTER APPLICATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY MUST NOT ONLY ENSURE BETTER
LENDING SERVICES, INCLUDING INTERLENDING, BUT ALSO COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION
RESOURCES AS WELL AS A WIDER DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION. LIKE OTHER
COUNTRIES, MOBILE LIBRARIES SHOULD CATER FOR HAMLETS AND SMALL COMMUNITIES OF
SOME 1,000 INHABITANTS, AND ALSO FOR URBAN POPULATIONS LIVING ON NEW HOUSING
ESTATES AND/OR IN OTHER AREAS TEMPORARILY WITHOUT LIBRARIES. PURPOSE-BUILT
BUILDINGS SHOULD BE ENVISAGED FOR E VERY LIBRARY WITH 70,000 AND MORE VOLUMES.
DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES, BOTH ON A NATIONAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL, SHOULD ALSO BE
PLANNED TO STORE VALUABLE BOOKS AND RARELY REQUESTED BOOKS.
