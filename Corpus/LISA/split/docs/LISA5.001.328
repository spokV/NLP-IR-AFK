CATALOGING AND CLASSIFICATION PRACTICES IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE LIBRARIES.

RESULTS OF A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY SENT TO A SAMPLE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE
LIBRARIES IN THE US INDICATE THAT AS THESE LIBRARIES ENTER THE 1980S THEIR
COLLECTIONS ARE STILL TRADITIONALLY ORGANISED. ALTHOUGH AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS
ARE NOW CATALOGUED AND CLASSIFIED, THERE IS LITTLE AGREEMENT AS TO HOW THEY
SHOULD BE ORGANISED; AND MOST AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS ARE STILL HOUSED IN
CLOSED-ACCESS AREAS. CHANGE TO AACR 2 SEEMS TO BE ACCEPTED, BUT LIBRARIANS ARE
STILL UNDECIDED ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN COMPUTERISED CATALOGUING NETWORKS.
