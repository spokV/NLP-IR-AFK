STAGNATION IN THE KIBBUTZ LIBRARY.

2 CHARACTERISTICS OF KIBBUTZ LIBRARIES ARE GIVING CAUSE FOR CONCERN;
DECENTRALISATION; AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF KIBBUTZ LIBRARIANS. DECENTRALISATION
HAS HISTORIC AND SOCIAL CAUSES. FORMERLY, MOST LIBRARIANS WERE VOLUNTEERS AND
VARIOUS GROUPS IN THE KIBBUTZ POPULATION HAD SEPARATE AREAS OF RESIDENCE AND
ACTIVITY. MODERN KIBBUTZ SOCIETY AND ORGANISATION HAVE CHANGED, BUT MANY SMALL
LIBRARIES HAVE REMAINED IN EXISTENCE. DECENTRALISATION HAS MANY DRAWBACKS'
INEFFICIENCY, AREAS OF INTEREST NOT COVERED BY ANY LIBRARY, INCONVENIENCE OF
MANY READERS AND LACK OF A STRONG LIBRARY THAT COULD BECOME A FOCAL POINT IN
THE CULTURAL LIFE OF THE KIBBUTZ. THE 24 LIBRARIANS SERVING IN THE KIBBUTZIM
SURVEYED AVERAGED 53.3 YEARS, ONLY 5 OF THEM BEING YOUNGER THAN 50. THIS
SITUATION RULES OUT MUCH IN THE WAY OF DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION. CALLS FOR A
SERIOUS ACADEMIC STUDY OF KIBBUTZ LIBRARIES.
