THE VALUE OF CONTROLLED INDEXING SYSTEMS IN ONLINE TEXT DATABASES.
     
WHILE THE VALUE OF CONTROLLED INDEXING TO SUPPLEMENT TEXT SEARCHING IS
RECOGNISED IN LIMITED TEXT (E.G. BIBLIOGRAPHIC) DATA BASES, TEXT SEARCHING IS
USUALLY THOUGHT TO GIVE SUFFICIENT SUBJECT ACCESS TO FULL TEXT DATA BASES.
ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM INFORMATION SCIENCE, COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND LINGUISTICS
ARE PUT FORWARD IN FAVOUR OF USING SOME FORM OF CONTROLLED LANGUAGE IN FULL
TEXT DATA BASES. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH A SYSTEM IN MARTINDEX, A FULL TEXT
DRUG INFORMATION DATA BANK, IS BRIEFLY DESCRIBED. POSSIBLE FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
IN SUBJECT ACCESS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED.
