AMERICAN LIBRARY SCENE (IMPRESSIONS OF AMERICAN LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS).
     
A USSR LIBRARIAN, FOR 8 YEARS (1970-78) THE DIRECTOR OF THE UN LIBRARY IN NEW
YORK, DESCRIBES IMPRESSIONS MADE ON HER BY US LIBRARIES AND US LIBRARY LIFE.
DEPENDENCE OF BOTH PUBLIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES ON PRIVATE CAPITAL IS THE
REASON FOR THEIR UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. MODERN LIBRARY
EQUIPMENT IN BOTH SMALL AND LARGE LIBRARIES, AUTOMATION, DEVELOPMENT OF
INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS AND LIBRARY COOPERATION ARE SEEN AS THE MAIN
ACHIEVEMENTS. LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION, MANAGEMENT, PERSONNEL (WITH SPECIAL
REFERENCE TO THE STATUS OF WOMEN), EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT SITUATION, THE ROLE
OF LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS IN US LIBRARIANSHIP, AND LIBRARY CONFERENCES AND THEIR
ORGANISATION ARE DISCUSSED.
