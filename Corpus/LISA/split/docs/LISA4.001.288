THE STUDY OF BRAZILIAN SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION, USING INSTITUTE OF SCIENTIFIC
INFORMATION DATA. II. THE ISI-ASCA-BRAZIL DATA BANK, A NEW TOOL FOR ANALYSING
BRAZILIAN SCIENCE.
     
A REPORT BY 2 BRAZILIAN RESEARCH SCIENTISTS ON THE INITIATION OF A NEW STAGE
IN THEIR PROJECT. DISCUSSES THEIR WORK TO DATE IN THIS FIELD, WITH REFERENCE
TO PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS, ANALYSING THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN COLLECTING
DATA BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION IN 1977 OF THE ISI AUTOMATED SUBJECT CITATION
ALERT (ASCA). FULL DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE NEW SERVICES AVAILABLE, ENABLING
THE AUTHORS TO ELABORATE A SEARCH PROFILE TO RETRIEVE EVERY ARTICLE PUBLISHED
BY SCIENTISTS FROM BRAZILIAN INSTITUTIONS. THE METHOD OF PROFILE CONSTRUCTION
IS DESCRIBED, AND RESULTS AFTER 6 MONTHS EVALUATED IN RELATION TO SUCCESS IN
SOLVING PREVIOUS PROBLEMS, SHOWING HOW THE WAY IS NOW OPEN TO ESTABLISHING AN
INEXPENSIVE, MULTI-DISCIPLINARY, AND UP-TO-DATE DATA BASE ON BRAZILIAN
SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION. IN CONCLUSION THE USES FOR THIS DATA BASE ARE
DISCUSSED, AND SUGGESTIONS MADE FOR IMPROVING COMPREHENSIVENESS BY COVERING
AREAS OUTSIDE THE ISI'S SCOPE.
