BIBLIOTHEKSDATA HAS A PLAN.
     
A STATEMENTS BY BIBLIOTEKSDATA ON ITS PAST ACHIEVEMENT AND FUTURE PLANS. SINCE
1974, THE LIBRARY CENTRE HAS BEEN BUILDING UP A DATA BASE OF NOW 280,000
TITLES, INVALUABLE FOR LIBRARIES IN THEIR STOCK REGISTRATION. THE EXPERIENCE
FROM THE AUTOMATION OF OLSTYKKE LIBRARY WILL ALSO BENEFIT THE FUTURE SYSTEM.
SPECIFICATIONS FOR REGISTRATION OF MATERIALS, ISSUE CONTROL AND CATALOGUES
HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. A PROJECT CONSISTING OF MODULES WHICH LIBRARIES CAN
ACCEPT GRADUALLY HAS NOW BEEN DEVELOPED. THE PROJECT IS DEPENDENT ON' COMPUTER
REGISTRATION OF LIBRARIES' STOCK, DECENTRALISED INPUT OF DATA IN OWN
TERMINALS, STANDARDISATION, GRADUAL INTRODUCTION OF MODULES AS THEY BECOME
READY, AND LOCALLY DETERMINED SELECTION OF MODULES. THE CATALOGUING MODULE
WILL BE READY AT THE END OF 1982, THE ISSUE AND ACQUISITIONS MODULES DURING
1983. THE BETA MODULE MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO REGISTER A LIBRARY'S HOLDINGS OF
TITLES ALREADY IN THE LIBRARY CENTRE BASE. SUPPLIERS OF HARDWARE ARE TO  BE
CHOSEN DURING SPRING 82; RUNNING COSTS CAN, THEREFORE, NOT BE CALCULATED YET.
