THE LAW FOR LOCAL AUTHORITY CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IS ONE MORE ON THE ROAD FOR
LEGISLATING CULTURAL ACTIVITIES.

THE NEW LAW CAME INTO EFFECT AT THE BEGINNING OF 1981. A LOCAL AUTHORITY HAS
TO SET UP A COMMITTEE FOR CULTURAL ACTIVITIES. OUT OF 84 TOWNS ONLY 9 HAD SUCH
A COMMITTEE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. ALL OTHER TYPES OF LOCAL
AUTHORITIES, 150 OF THEM, DID NOT HAVE ONE. THE DUTIES OF THE COMMITTEES ARE
THE OVERSIGHT AND INSTIGATION OF CULTURAL ACTIVITIES, COOPERATION BETWEEN
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES PUBLICITY, PROVISION OF ACCOMMODATION, AND
BUDGET. FROM 1982 STATE GRANTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR STAFF AND ORGANISATION
COSTS. THE NEW LAW SHOULD EASE THE WORK OF LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS WHO UNTIL
NOW HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ORGANISATION OF MANY OF THE LOCAL CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES.
