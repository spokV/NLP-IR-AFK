INTRODUCING ONLINE DATA BASE SEARCHING IN THE SMALL ACADEMIC LIBRARY: A MODEL
FOR SERVICE WITHOUT CHARGE TO UNDERGRADUATES.

THE IMPACT ON SMALL ACADEMIC LIBRARIES OF SEARCHING PERIODICAL INDEXES ON-LINE
HAS NOT BEEN AS WIDESPREAD AS THAT OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION, RESOURCE
SHARING, OR OCLC. BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION WAS INTEGRATED EASILY INTO NORMAL
WORK ROUTINES AND OCLC WAS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE, BUT ON-LINE SEARCHING DOES
NOT APPEAR TO OFFER SUCH ADVANTAGES AND LEARNING TO OPERATE A TERMINAL CAN
SEEM TO BE ALIEN. DESCRIBES THE INTRODUCTION OF ON-LINE SEARCH FACILITIES AT
LAKE FOREST COLLEGE, A SMALL LIBERAL ARTS ESTABLISHMENT WITH A FACULTY OF 100
AND 1,000 STUDENTS. THE FACILITY WAS INITIATED WITH THE HELP OF A RESEARCH
GRANT, BUT HAS SINCE EARNED SUFFICIENT FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT TO
ENSURE ITS CONTINUATION.
