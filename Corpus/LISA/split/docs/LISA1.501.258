RATIONALISATION AND MODELLIFICATION' TWO COMPLEMENTARY IMPLICATIONS OF
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES.
     
DEBATES ON THE EFFECTS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES ARE USUALLY LIMITED TO 3

RATIONALISATION OF THE LABOUR PROCESS(ES) INVOLVED; MODELLIFICATION
(PLANNING/REGULATING/CONTROLLING) OF THE PERSONS/THINGS/PROCEDURES MODELLED BY

PRACTICAL TERMS HOW TO AVOID NEGATIVE AND PROMOTE POSITIVE CONSEQUENCES.
