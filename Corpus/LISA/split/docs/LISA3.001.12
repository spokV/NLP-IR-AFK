IN THE SHADOW OF THE BLACK KRONE.
     
REPORTS ON THE SWEDISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL MEETING IN KIRUNA, JUNE
81. LIBRARIES WERE ACCUSED OF FIXATING ON LOAN FIGURES AND NEGLECTING QUALITY.
PROTESTS AGAINST CUTS IN LIBRARY EXPENDITURE AND CALLS FOR A LIBRARY LAW HAVE
COME FROM PUBLISHERS, AUTHORS AND TRADE UNIONS, AS WELL AS LIBRARIANS. BUT THE
PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION'S REMIT DOES NOT INCLUDE PROPOSALS FOR A LAW, NOR
MAY IT RECOMMEND ACTION WHICH INVOLVES FURTHER EXPENDITURE. IT IS FOREMOST AN
EXAMINATION OF THE STATUS QUO. IT HOPES TO DRAW ON THE FINDINGS OF THE DALA
PROJECT, A LITERATURE CAMPAIGN STARTING IN AUTUMN 81. AN ACCOUNT OF THE
VIDEOGRAM COMMISSION'S WORK WAS GIVEN; STRESS WAS LAID ON THE POSITIVE ASPECTS
OF VIDEO, SUCH AS GREATER AVAILABILITY OF RARE AND UNPOPULAR FILMS AND AIDS
FOR MINORITIES. A DISTRIBUTION NETWORK FOR SERIOUS VIDEO PRODUCTION INVOLVING
LIBRARIES WAS CALLED FOR. A RESOLUTION AGAINST THE INTRODUCTION OF LENDING
FEES AND FOR A LIBRARY LAW WAS REJECTED AS UNANI MITY AMONG REPRESENTATIVES
WAS LACKING.
