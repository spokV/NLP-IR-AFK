DISCUSSES MANY OF THE POSSIBLE RESPONSIBILITIES OF AND DECISIONS RELATING TO
THE PUBLIC USE OF SERIALS COLLECTIONS. CONSIDERS WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE
ARRANGED IN ALPHABETICAL OR CLASSIFICATION ORDER; FACTORS AFFECTING A DECISION
TO PROVIDE OPEN STACK COLLECTIONS THAT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE FOR
PUBLIC USE OR CLOSED ONES WHICH ARE SERVICED ON A PAGING SYSTEM; AND THE
REFERENCE FUNCTIONS OF SERIALS WORK. FINALLY, QUESTIONS WHETHER PERIODICALS
OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO CIRCULATE OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY.
