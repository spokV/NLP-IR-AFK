IN CONVERSATION WITH INA VINTGES.
     
TEXT OF A DISCUSSION WITH W.M.E. VINTGES WHO RETIRED FROM HER POST AS HEAD OF
LIBRARY AFFAIRS AT THE NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LECTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH
CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) IN NOV 81. UNTIL 1962 MRS VINTGES HAD
BEEN HEAD OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC PUBLIC LIBRARY AT TILBURG, A POST WHICH
INVOLVED HER IN SERVING ON A NUMBER OF NATIONAL COMMITTEES. IN 1962 MRS.
VINTGES WAS APPOINTED GENERAL CONSULTANT WITH THE CENTRALE VERENIGING VOOR
OPENBARE BIBLIOTHEKEN (CENTRAL ASSOCIATION FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES) AND JOINED
THE STAFF OF THE NBLC IN 1972. MRS VINTGES FEELS THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW OF
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS TOO RESTRICTED AND THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS A BASIC
SERVICE FOR EDUCATION AND SOCIAL WELFARE SHOULD NO LONGER BE REGARDED AS
PURELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
