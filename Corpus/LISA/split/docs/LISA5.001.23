THE LIBRARY OF THE HAMBURG CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

THERE HAS BEEN A COMMERCIAL LIBRARY IN HAMBURG SINCE 1735. STOCKS INCLUDE
ABOUT 140,000 BOOKS AND OVER 500 GERMAN AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE PERIODICALS;
ABOUT 3,000 ITEMS ARE ADDED ANNUALLY. ALTHOUGH MUCH MATERIAL WAS DESTROYED IN
WORLD WAR II THE LIBRARY IS STILL VALUABLE TO BUSINESS PEOPLE, STUDENTS AND
RESEARCH WORKERS. SUBJECTS COVERED INCLUDE ECONOMICS, SOCIAL SCIENCE,
COMMERCIAL LAW, POLITICS AND PSYCHOLOGY. THE PROXIMITY OF THE UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY OBVIATES THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE SUBJECT COVERAGE, WHICH IS AN
ADVANTAGE OWING TO THE INCREASED NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS, THE CURRENT FINANCIAL
CRISIS AND THE GROWTH OF NEW SUBJECTS LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.
TRADITIONAL MANUAL PROCESSING METHODS ARE STILL FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE HERE,
ALTHOUGH ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING MAY BE IMPLEMENTED LATER.
