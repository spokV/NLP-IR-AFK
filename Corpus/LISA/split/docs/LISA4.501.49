LIBRARIES AFTER THE 10TH PARTY CONFERENCE.
     
A DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR TRADES UNION LIBRARIES IN 1981 WAS DRAWN UP TO FURTHER
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS; THE PLAN'S EFFECT ON THE LIBRARY IN VEB
KOMBINAT NARVA, AN EAST BERLIN ELECTRIC LIGHT BULB FACTORY IS DESCRIBED. CLOSE
COOPERATION IS ADVOCATED WITH THE COLLECTIVES AND WITH OTHER CULTURAL
ORGANISATIONS AND THE EXPANSION OF STOCKS AND INFORMATION SERVICES. STUDENTS
AT THE INDUSTRIAL TRAINING SCHOOL WERE TO BE INTRODUCED TO THE LIBRARY
SERVICES AT THE START OF THEIR COURSES AND SUITABLE LITERATURE PROVIDED FOR
INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL STUDIES AND FOR LEISURE ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT
SEVERAL APPRENTICE CLASSES MADE VISITS TO THE LIBRARY AND MORE LITERARY EVENTS
AND DISPLAYS WERE ORGANISED. IT IS HOPED THAT 1981 LOANS WILL INCREASE TO
75,000 AND THAT AT LEAST 55% OF WORKERS UNDER 25 WILL BE REGISTERED LIBRARY
MEMBERS.
