NEED FOR TELECOMMUNICATION STANDARDS FOR INTERCONNECTION WITH THE U.S. POSTAL
SERVICE EMSS (ELECTRONIC MAIL SERVICE SYSTEM).

DESCRIBES THE EFFORT WHICH WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO DETERMINE TELECOMMUNICATION
STANDARDS NECESSARY FOR INTERCONNECTION TO THE US POSTAL SERVICE (USPS)
PLANNED LONG-RANGE ELECTRONIC MAIL SERVICE SYSTEM (EMSS). THIS WORK IS IN
COMPLIANCE WITH AN ADMINISTRATION POLICY STATEMENT WHICH REQUIRES THAT
ORGANISATIONS DESIRING TO INPUT MESSAGES INTO A FUTURE USPS EMSS VIA
TELECOMMUNICATIONS MEANS CAN DO SO IF THE INTERCONNECTION STANDARDS ARE
SATISFIED.
