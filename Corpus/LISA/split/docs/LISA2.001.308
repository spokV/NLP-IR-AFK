RESEARCH STRATEGIES' BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION FOR UNDERGRADUATES.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. EXAMINES THEORY
AND PRACTICE CONCERNED WITH THE NATURE OF EDUCATION IN RESEARCH STRATEGIES-OR
SEARCH STRATEGIES, THE MORE COMMONLY USED DESIGNATION. RECOGNISES THE
DISAGREEMENT AMONGST PROFESSIONALS ABOUT THE PRECISE MEANING OF THESE TERMS,
AND DISCUSSES THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION IN RESEARCH
STRATEGIES' THE LEVEL OF STUDENT TO BE TAUGHT; THE CONTENT OF INSTRUCTION; THE
METHODS USED TO TEACH; AND WHO SHOULD TEACH. USES EXAMPLES FROM THE SOCIAL
SCIENCES TO ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE POINTS MADE IN THESE DISCUSSIONS. CONCLUDES
THAT THE SUCCESSFUL EDUCATION OF UNDERGRADUATES IN RESEARCH STRATEGIES HINGES
PRIMARILY ON THE DECISION ABOUT WHAT IS TO BE TAUGHT, AND THAT THE OTHER
QUESTIONS, ALTHOUGH NOT UNIMPORTANT, ARE AT PRESENT, OF SECONDARY CONCERN.
