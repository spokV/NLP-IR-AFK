AUTOMATION: A CHALLENGE TO THE SOCIAL FUNCTION OF THE LIBRARY AND THE SOCIAL
CHARACTER OF THE STAFF?.

DISCUSSES THE IDEAS OF COBABUS AND THIEM ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
AUTOMATION AND' (1) PRODUCTIVITY; (2) PRODUCT QUALITY; (3) STAFF
QUALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING, AND THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS ON
EXPENDITURE UPON THESE RELATIONSHIPS. AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES TENDS TO LAG
BEHIND AUTOMATION IN OTHER FIELDS BUT IT DEMANDS CHANGES IN STAFF TRAINING,
INTELLECTUALISATION OF PRODUCTION WORK AND A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC
AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. PROCESSES PREVIOUSLY SEPARATED CAN BE INTEGRATED BY
AUTOMATION. BEFORE AUTOMATION THERE WAS A TENDENCY TOWARDS RIGIDITY IN THE
HIGHER STAFF GRADES; NOW AUTOMATION REQUIRES CHANGES IN THE STAFF HIERARCHY
AND THE OLD IDEA OF THE 'CLASSICAL LIBRARIAN'.
