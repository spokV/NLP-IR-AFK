SUMMER READING CLUBS COVER CABELL COUNTY.

CABELL COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY'S SUMMER READING PROGRAMME 'SUMMER OF FUN' AND
OTHER PROGRAMMES, ORGANISED WITH THE COOPERATION OF HUNTINGTON'S PUBLIC
TELEVISION STATION, WPBY, REACHED OVER 500 YOUNG PEOPLE FROM PRE-SCHOOL AGE TO
YOUNG ADULTS IN 1981. YOUNG PEOPLE SHOWED A WILLINGNESS TO BE GUIDED AND
SUSTAINED BY PERSONAL INTEREST RATHER THAN INDUCEMENTS SUCH AS AWARDS OR
CERTIFICATES. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT READING CAN LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER
SKILLS, AS WELL AS BEING STIMULATING IN ITSELF. EVALUATION OF THE 1981
PROGRAMME WILL BE USED IN THE PLANNING OF THE 1982 FORMAT.
