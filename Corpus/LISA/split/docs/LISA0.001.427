EVALUATION OF AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR ASSESSMENT OF TOXICOLOGICAL
EFFECTS OF CHEMICALS ON FISH, WILDLIFE AND ECOSYSTEM COMPONENTS.

A USER-ORIENTED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IS NEEDED FOR ASSESSMENT OF
MATERIALS HAZARDOUS TO FISH, WILDLIFE, FOOD CHAIN ORGANISMS, AND OTHER
ORGANISMS ESSENTIAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES AND FUNCTIONS.
CRITICAL EVALUATION OF DATA ALSO REQUIRES RIGOROUS DOCUMENTATION OF TEST
CONDITIONS, PRECISION OF METHODS USED, AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE TEST
ORGANISM. PARTICULAR EMPHASIS OF THE EVALUATION WAS IN DEVELOPING PRACTICAL
CRITERIA THAT AID IN THE USE AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA WITH RESPECT TO NEED
FOR FURTHER TESTING IN A SCORING EXERCISE PERFORMED FOR THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES
CONTROL ACT INTERAGENCY TESTING COMMITTEE. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE
INTEGRATION OF INFORMATION ON PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES, HEALTH
EFFECTS, ECOTOXICOLOGY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCENTRATION OR EXPOSURE LEVEL.
