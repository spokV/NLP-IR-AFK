THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC SITUATION' FUTURE PLANS AND PRIORITIES FOR NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL WORK.
     
2NORSK BOKFORTEGNELSE1, THE MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE NORWEGIAN NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHY, COMPRISES MATERIAL RECEIVED THROUGH LEGAL DEPOSIT OR DONATION BY
OSLO UNIVERSITY'S NORWEGIAN DEPARTMENT. IT HAS BEEN COMPUTER-PRODUCED SINCE
1972. NORWEGIAN BOOK PRODUCTION INCREASED BY 105% DURING 1970-78, WHILE
NORWEGIAN PARTICIPATION IN UBC AND ISDS HAS NECESSITATED THE INTRODUCTION OF
AACR, ISBD AND ISBN. STAFFING HAS NOT BEEN INCREASED PROPORTIONATELY, AND
CONSIDERABLE ARREARS OF UNCATALOGUED MATERIAL EXIST. THE 5-YEARLY CUMULATION
FOR 1971-75 IS AT PRESENT AVAILABLE IN MACHINE-READABLE FORM ONLY. A
MICROFICHE CATALOGUE OF NORWEGIAN PUBLICATIONS IS PRODUCED BI-MONTHLY, WITH
CUMULATIONS FOR 1971-75 AND 1976-78. THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHY DATA BASE IS ALREADY PARTLY ON-LINE. INDEXING OF PERIODICAL
ARTICLES, PLANNED FROM 1980, WILL COVER 400 PERIODICALS IN MOST SUBJECT
FIELDS. NEWSPAPE R ARTICLES CANNOT BE COVERED MEANWHILE. THE 2BIBLIOGRAPHY OF
NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS1 (1965-) SHOULD SOON BE INCORPORATED INTO
THE DATA BASE. FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS ABOUT NORWAY (1978-) ARE INDEXED IN
MACHINE-READABLE FORM.
