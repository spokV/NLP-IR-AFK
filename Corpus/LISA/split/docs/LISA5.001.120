THE PLANNABLE AND UNPLANNABLE (1)' LIBRARIES AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF
PRESERVATION AND CHANGE.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND
THE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, OCT 80. LIBRARY
SERVICES MUST REACT AND DEVELOP IN RELATION TO SOCIAL CHANGE. THEY MUST CATER
FOR THE NEEDS OF BOTH URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES, WHERE TOWN AND COUNTRY
PLANNING HAS SO OFTEN FAILED. WORKING HOURS ARE SHORTER NOW THAN IN THE PAST,
SO LIBRARIES MUST DEVELOP FACILITIES FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RECREATIONAL READING
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MASS MEDIA. CHILDREN USE LIBRARIES MORE THAN ADULTS
BUT THE BIRTH RATE HAS FALLEN AND THERE ARE MORE ELDERLY PEOPLE IN THE
COMMUNITY TODAY THAN BEFORE; THIS, HOWEVER, IS NO EXCUSE FOR A DECLINE IN
LIBRARY STANDARDS. LIBRARIES MUST BECOME COMMUNICATION CENTRES, IN PARTICULAR
TO HELP THE MANY PEOPLE LIVING ALONE AND THE 4 MILLION FOREIGNERS IN WEST
GERMANY.
