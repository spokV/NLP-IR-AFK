ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES FOR LIBRARY AUTOMATION' A NETWORK PERSPECTIVE.
     
DISCUSSES WHY THERE ARE SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SERVICES
AND PRODUCTS (BY BOTH COMMERCIAL AND NON-PROFIT VENDORS OF AUTOMATION) TO MEET
THE NEEDS OF LIBRARIES; WHY AFTER YEARS OF PLANNING AND PREPARATION, WHOLE
SUB-SYSTEMS DO NOT FUNCTION OR PERFORM AT UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR PRICES; AND
WHY, IN THE CONTINUING EXCHANGE BETWEEN REGIONAL LIBRARY NETWORKS AND NATIONAL
COMPANIES AND AGENCIES, THERE ARE SO FEW ACHIEVEMENTS IN COOPERATION, JOINT
DEVELOPMENT AND FUNDING, AND CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS. VENDORS MUST STOP
USING PROFESSIONAL MARKETERS IN PLANNING DEVELOPMENTS; THEY MUST COMMUNICATE
DIRECTLY WITH LIBRARIES INSTEAD. THEY SHOULD ALSO COOPERATE AMONGST THEMSELVES
AND REALISE THE POTENTIAL OF WORKING WITH LIBRARY NETWORKS RATHER THAN
INDIVIDUAL NETWORK MEMBERS.
