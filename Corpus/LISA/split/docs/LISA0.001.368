SYSTEM OF IMPRINTS. REPORT AND PROPOSALS.

A DESCRIPTION OF A FRANCO-BRITISH PROJECT OF 15 YEARS' DURATION TO DEVELOP A
FORMULA FOR MATCHING ALL COPIES OF THE SAME EDITION, FOR USE IN COMPILING AN
AUTOMATED UNION CATALOGUE OF OLD BOOKS. THE AGREED METHOD IS DESCRIBED IN
DETAIL, WITH EXAMPLES OF CASES WHERE IT APPLIES EASILY, AND A REPORT ON
RESEARCH TO ESTABLISH THE INCIDENCE OF FALLIBILITY, AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS.
THE FUNCTION AND APPLICATION OF THE FORMULA IN CATALOGUING IS DEMONSTRATED,
WITH PROPOSALS THAT ITS USE BE EXTENDED TO COMPLEMENT TRADITIONAL CATALOGUING
PRACTICE AND SHOW THE HISTORY OF A TEXT BY ESTABLISHING 'FAMILIES OF
IMPRINTS'. THE GUIDE FOR USERS, TO BE PUBLISHED SHORTLY, IS REPRODUCED IN AN
APPENDIX.
