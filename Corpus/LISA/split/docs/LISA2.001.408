MASS STORAGE TECHNOLOGY AND FILE ORGANIZATION.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CHINESE LIBRARY AUTOMATION,
TAIPEI, TAIWAN, 14-19 FEB 81. CONSIDERS THE RAPID EVOLUTION OF MASS STORAGE
TECHNOLOGY AND ITS INFLUENCE ON FILE ORGANISATION. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES HAVE
MADE WHAT SEEMED IMPRACTICAL IN 1971 BECOME EMINENTLY PRACTICAL IN 1981 AND
LIBRARIANS MUST THUS EXAMINE THE TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT TO DETERMINE WHICH
OF THEIR PERCEIVED LIMITATIONS ARE REAL AND WHICH ARE ILLUSORY AND SOON TO BE
SMASHED. THIS EXAMINATION IS PERHAPS MOST ESSENTIAL FOR MASS STORAGE FILE
ORGANISATION AS THIS HAS THE MOST MARKED AND LONG-LASTING EFFECT ON THE
PERFORMANCE OF AUTOMATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS.
