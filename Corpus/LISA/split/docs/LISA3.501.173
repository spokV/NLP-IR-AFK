POLITICS OF LOCAL INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION.
     
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ISSUES ARE KEY FACTORS IN DEVELOPING COOPERATION AMONG US
PUBLIC LIBRARIES. EXPERIENCES IN PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION HAVE SHOWN THAT
THE ACCEPTANCE OF COOPERATION AS AN IDEAL, PATRON REACTION AND ACCEPTANCE,
LOCAL PRIDE AND CONTROL, AND THE EDUCATION AND COOPERATION OF THE LIBRARY
BOARD, LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND FUNDING AGENCIES ARE ALL IMPORTANT IN
PROVIDING THE BEST POSSIBLE FRAMEWORK FOR COOPERATION. THE COMMITMENT TO AND
UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPLICATIONS, CHANGES, AND MODIFICATIONS THAT COOPERATION
REQUIRES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT. REALISATION THAT INTERPRETATION OF WHAT
COOPERATION MEANS AND THAT UNEQUAL CONTRIBUTIONS CAN BE EXPECTED ARE NECESSARY
STEPS IN DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS AMONG PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
