PERIOD IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THEIR INFORMATION NEEDS AND THEIR APPROACHES TO
MEETING THEM. ACADEMIC STAFF WERE THEN INTERVIEWED TO DISCOVER THEIR
PERCEPTION OF THE STUDENTS' INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS. THE FINDINGS ARE
SUMMARISED WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN SOLVING THE
STUDENTS' INFORMATION NEEDS. THE RELEVANCE OF THE FINDINGS TO THE PLANNING OF
LIBRARY USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES ARE DISCUSSED.
