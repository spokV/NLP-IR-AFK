AN INTEGRATED PROFICIENCY APPROACH TO PRE-PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING.
     
TAKING AS A STARTING POINT THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION COMMITTEE ON
ACCREDITATION'S LIST OF ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL LIBRARIANS, PRESENTS A
DETAILED ITEMISATION OF THE MINIMUM PROFESSIONAL SKILLS ESSENTIAL FOR A
PRE-SERVICE LIBRARIAN, STRUCTURED IN 6 PRINCIPLE DIVISIONS, COVERING
UNDERSTANDING OF' THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNICATION OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE;
LIBRARIES AND LIBRARY SCIENCE; COLLECTION BUILDING; ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY
MATERIALS; LIBRARY SERVICES; AND MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES. APPLICATIONS OF THIS
ANALYTICAL PRESCRIPTION IN PLANNING AND EVALUATING CURRICULA ARE SUGGESTED,
WHICH WOULD ENSURE INCLUSION OF ALL ESSENTIAL PHILOSOPHICAL AND THEORETICAL
COMPONENTS IN TRAINING PROGRAMMES.
