SERIALS INVENTORY: A CASE STUDY.
     
A SERIALS UNIVERSITY PROJECT OF OVER 400,000 VOLUMES WAS UNDERTAKEN AT THE
TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. THE INVENTORY PROCEDURE IS DESCRIBED.
STATISTICS FROM THE INVENTORY INDICATE THAT THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR ALARM OVER
EXPENSIVE SERIAL VOLUMES DISAPPEARING FROM LIBRARY SHELVES. THE SUCCESSFUL
COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT SHOWS THAT AN INVENTORY OF A LARGE SERIALS
COLLECTION REMAINS A SOUND METHOD IN MANAGING SERIALS COLLECTIONS.
