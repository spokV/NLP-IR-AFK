THE ROMANIZATION OF CYRILLIC SCRIPT.
     
IN TERMS OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE MATERIAL IS 2ND ONLY TO
ENGLISH LANGUAGE PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL NO GENERALLY ACCEPTED
SCHEME IN THE WESTERN WORLD FOR CONVERTING CYRILLIC CHARACTERS INTO ROMAN
SCRIPT. TRANSCRIPTION, BY WHICH CYRILLIC CHARACTERS ARE ROMANIZED INTO
PHONEMES, GIVES GOOD RESULTS FOR PRONUNCIATION BUT LEADS TO A NUMBER OF
ALTERNATIVE SPELLINGS, WHILST TRANSLITERATION, BY WHICH A SINGLE ROMAN
CHARACTER IS SUBSTITUTED FOR EACH CYRILLIC CHARACTER LEADS TO PRONUNCIATION
DIFFICULTIES. WITH THE GROWTH IN SCHEMES FOR CATALOGUE AUTOMATION IT IS
ESSENTIAL THAT A SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THIS PROBLEM. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT
THE ISO STANDARD OFFERS THE BEST SOLUTION ALTHOUGH THIS HAS UNFORTUNATELY
FOUND LITTLE FAVOUR IN THE USA AND UK.
