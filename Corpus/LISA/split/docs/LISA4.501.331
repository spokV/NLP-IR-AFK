THE GUIDELINE ON STOCK EXPANSION IN GENERAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
IN THE 1976-80 GUIDELINES ON LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY, LONG-TERM STOCK
PLANNING WAS ADVOCATED ON A BASIS OF DIFFERENTIAL VALUES FOR STOCK ITEMS PER
INHABITANT, SO THAT STOCKS CAN BE ACQUIRED WHICH ALLOW FOR SOCIAL DEMANDS.
FUNCTIONAL EQUIPPING OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY IS NECESSARY TO FACILITATE
REGIONAL PURCHASING SCHEME DEVELOPMENT. THE STOCK GUIDELINE FOR 1981-85
EMPHASISES STOCK EXPANSION AND THE PURCHASE OF REPLACEMENT COPIES; OTHER
GUIDELINES COVER THE EXPANSION OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA SERVICES, NEW RULES ON
THE PURCHASE OF PERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS AND EXTRA PROVISION OF BOOKS IN
HOLIDAY RESORTS. THE LATEST GUIDELINES SHOULD REMOVE UNJUSTIFIABLE DIFFERENCES
IN STOCK STANDARDS.
