DISTANCE EDUCATION AND THE CIAE LIBRARY, REPORT ON ONE PLANNING SURVEY.
     
EXTERNAL STUDIES PLACE NEW DEMANDS ON COLLEGE LIBRARIES. IN 1978, CAPRICORNIA
INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION (CIAE) WAS FACED WITH DIFFICULTIES IN COPING
WITH DEMANDS FROM EXTERNAL STUDENTS. THE COLLEGE CARRIED OUT A SURVEY, SENDING
QUESTIONNAIRES TO 40 COLLEGES IN AUSTRALIA; THE RESULTS ARE OUTLINED. MAJOR
CONCLUSIONS WERE THAT SERVICES BY COLLEGE LIBRARIES FOR EXTERNAL STUDENTS WERE
VARIED, AND IN AN EMBRYONIC STAGE, AND THERE WAS URGENT NEED FOR THE
DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS FOR LIBRARY SERVICES TO EXTERNAL STUDENTS. MORE
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE LIBRARIAN AND EXTERNAL STUDIES DEPARTMENT STAFF WAS
NEEDED. THE CONCLUSIONS ENABLED THE CIAE TO REFINE OBJECTIVES AND TO EXPAND
THE CONCEPT OF THE EXTERNAL STUDIES LIBRARY SERVICE. NOTE' THIS ABSTRACT IS A
CORRECTED VERSION OF AN EARLIER ABSTRACT AND REPLACES 80/4299.
