THE EXPANSION OF THE RURAL LIBRARY SERVICE IN BAVARIA WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF
THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BAVARIAN LIBRARIES.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE 29TH CONFERENCE OF STATE LIBRARY CENTRES IN WEST GERMANY,
BURGHAUSEN, SEPT 81. BASIC PROVISION OF STOCKS AND STAFF IS STILL NOT AS GOOD
IN RURAL AS IN URBAN AREAS; FURTHER FINANCIAL PROVISION FROM THE STATE IS
NECESSARY IF LIBRARY SERVICES ARE TO BE IMPROVED. PLANS FOR IMPROVING BAVARIAN
LIBRARIES ARE LINKED CLOSELY WITH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES. EVERY VILLAGE
WITH OVER 3,000 INHABITANTS HAS A BRANCH LIBRARY AND SMALLER VILLAGES ARE
SERVED BY MOBILE LIBRARIES, MORE OF WHICH ARE STILL NEEDED. CLOSURE OF MANY
SMALL BRANCH LIBRARIES HAS RESULTED IN A CONCENTRATION OF SERVICES AND IN
INCREASED STOCKS AND READERSHIP. COOPERATION BETWEEN PUBLIC AND SCHOOL
LIBRARIES AND BETWEEN LOCAL AUTHORITY AND CHURCH PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS VERY
IMPORTANT.
