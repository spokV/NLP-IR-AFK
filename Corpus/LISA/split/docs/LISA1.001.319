TEST STUDIES OF THE REFERENCE SERVICES OF GERMAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

IN AUTUMN 79 A STUDY OF REFERENCE SERVICES IN GERMAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS
CARRIED OUT. A RESEARCHER POSED AS A LIBRARY USER AT SELECTED LIBRARIES AND
ANSWERS HE RECEIVED TO REFERENCE QUERIES WERE THEN EVALUATED FOR
COMPREHENSIVENESS AND ACCURACY. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS NOT TO ASSESS THE
QUALITY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY REFERENCE SERVICES OR TO SINGLE OUT INDIVIDUAL
LIBRARIES; INSTEAD IT DEMONSTRATES A NEW METHODOLOGY WHICH CAN PRODUCE DATA
BEYOND THE MERELY QUANTITATIVE DATA WHICH PREVIOUSLY COULD BE INTERPRETED, FOR
THE MOST PART, FROM LIBRARY STATISTICS.
