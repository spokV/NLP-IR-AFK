GOVERNMENTS COME AND GO-ALA REMAINS.
     
DESCRIBES THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1876 AND HAS
35,000 MEMBERS IN THE USA AND CANADA. ITS MEMBERS ARE MAINLY INDIVIDUAL
LIBRARIANS, BUT ALSO LIBRARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS, AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS. ITS
PUBLICATIONS ILLUSTRATE THE WIDE COVERAGE OF ITS ACTIVITIES' CATALOGUING
RULES, LIBRARY PLANNING, EDUCATION, AUTOMATION, PR MATERIAL. IT DOES NOT ACT
AS A TRADITIONAL TRADE UNION, BUT THE PRESSURE ON ITS OFFICE FOR LIBRARY
PERSONNEL RESOURCES TO TAKE UP THE MATTER OF UNEQUAL PAY IS STRONG, ESPECIALLY
FROM YOUNGER WOMEN, AND THE OFFICE IS NOW PUBLISHING ANNUAL SURVEYS OF
SALARIES. IN LINE WITH THIS, THE ALA IS BOYCOTTING STATES WHO HAVE NOT
RATIFIED THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT, A DECISION WHICH HAS CAUSED FRICTION IN
THE ASSOCIATION. ALTHOUGH THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION HAS MEANT CUTS FOR
LIBRARIES, THE ALA IS CONFIDENT THAT IT CAN RIDE THE STORM.
