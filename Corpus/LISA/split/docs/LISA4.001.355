A SPECIAL CLASSIFICATION FOR GENERAL LINGUISTICS.
     
THE CLASSIFICATION DESCRIBED IS A SHORTENED VERSION OF A CLASSIFICATION USED
FOR A CLASSIFIED CATALOGUE OF GENERAL LINGUISTICS AND ORIGINALLY DEVISED FOR
THE SYSTEMATIC DOCUMENTATION OF ESSAYS AND DEPENDENT WORKS AT THE INSTITUTE OF
GENERAL LINGUISTICS IN MUNSTER. SINCE THE ESSAYS ARE ON HIGHLY SPECIALISED
SUBJECTS, A CLASSIFICATION OF GREAT DEPTH WAS NEEDED WHICH, BECAUSE OF COSTS
AND ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEMS, HAD TO BE OPERABLE MANUALLY. MANUAL PROCEDURES
ALSO REDUCE THE RISK OF FAULTY INDEXING. THE CLASSIFICATION IS STRICTLY
HIERARCHIC SINCE IT MUST BE CAPABLE OF VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL EXPANSION
WITHOUT RISK OF STRUCTURAL ALTERATION. WORK ON THE SCHEME BEGAN IN 1978; THE
21 MAIN CLASSES ARE LISTED WITH THEIR SUBORDINATE SECTIONS.
