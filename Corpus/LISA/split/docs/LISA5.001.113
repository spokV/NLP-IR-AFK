BULGARIAN AND FOREIGN LITERATURE ON ENERGY IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF
BULGARIA.

A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF LITERATURE ON ENERGY, AVAILABLE AT PRESENT, IN
BULGARIAN LIBRARIES. ALL POSSIBLE ASPECTS ARE COVERED. FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS IN
THIS IMPORTANT FIELD WERE PREDOMINANTLY FRENCH AND GERMAN IN THE 1940S, BUT
NOWADAYS, 60% IS WRITTEN IN RUSSIAN FOLLOWED BY MATERIALS IN ENGLISH. DURING
THE PAST 20 YEARS, EVEN THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARIES HAVE ESTABLISHED
SPECIAL COLLECTIONS ON ENERGY. MAJOR LIBRARIES HAVE SPECIALISED IN 3 AREAS.
FIRSTLY, THE CENTRAL TECHNICAL LIBRARY AND THE LIBRARY OF THE BULGARIAN
ACADEMY OF SCIENCES HAVE BUILT UP THEORETICAL COLLECTIONS AND OTHERS OF
SPECIALIST INTEREST, E.G. ON NUCLEAR ENERGY. SECONDLY, REFERENCE PUBLICATIONS
ARE TO BE FOUND MAINLY AT THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY WHILE
THIRDLY TECHNICAL COLLEGES AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS OF HIGHER TECHNICAL
EDUCATION CONCENTRATE ON ALL ASPECTS OF ELECTRICAL POWER, INSTALLATIONS,
INSTRUMENTS, AND SO ON. IN ALL LIBRARIES, THE STAFF RESPONSIBLE FOR NEW
ACQUISITIONS MUST BEAR IN MIND THE LATEST TRENDS, E.G. CONVERSION OF CHEMICAL
ENERGY INTO LIGHT, WHERE, SO FAR, THE LITERATURE AVAILABLE IS ALMOST
NEGLIGIBLE.
