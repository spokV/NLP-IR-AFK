THE RISE IN THE AVERAGE PRICE OF MONOGRAPHS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

THE SURVEY COVERS ONLY PRICES OF MONOGRAPHS IN EAST GERMANY. THE RANGE AND
CRITERIA FOR THE RANDOM SAMPLE CORRESPONDS TO THE PURCHASING POLICY OF A
LIBRARY AT THE 2ND LEVEL ACCORDING TO 2BIBLIOTHEKSPLAN '731, (2LIBRARY PLAN
19731). THE STATISTICS SHOW DEVELOPMENTS FROM 1975-79 IN AMOUNTS SPENT AND
PROPORTIONS OF A TOTAL BUDGET. FROM THESE FIGURES IT CAN BE SEEN THAT 840,000
DM WOULD HAVE BEEN NEEDED FOR MONOGRAPH PURCHASE IN 1980, A BUDGET ONLY
EXCEEDED BY 17 LIBRARIES AT THIS LEVEL. PRICE RISES VARIED ACCORDING TO TYPE
OF MATERIAL BUT SHOWED RELATIVE STABILITY WHERE LIBRARY SELECTION WAS
CONCERNED. FROM THESE FIGURES THE AVERAGE EXPENDITURE REQUIRED FOR 1982 CAN BE
CALCULATED.
