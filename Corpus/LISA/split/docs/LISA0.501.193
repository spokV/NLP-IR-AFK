ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS IN COLLEGES OF FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION.

ARGUES THAT, AS A GENERALISATION, LIBRARIANS WHO REGARD THEMSELVES AS ACTING
WITHIN AN EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT BEHAVE RATHER DIFFERENTLY FROM THOSE WHO
STRESS THEIR LIBRARIANSHIP FUNCTIONS AND THAT THESE DIFFERENCES ARE RELATED TO
ACADEMIC STATUS. THE AWARD OF ACADEMIC STATUS ENCOURAGES THE FORMER BY
ATTRACTING AND RETAINING THOSE WILLING TO ADOPT AN EXTENDED EDUCATIONAL ROLE.
ACADEMIC RANK ALSO ELICITS THE INTERNALISATION, OR SELF-ASCRIPTION, BY THE
LIBRARIAN OF EDUCATIONAL ROLES.
