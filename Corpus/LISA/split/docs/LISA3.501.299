THE ELECTRONIC FUTURE-IMPACT ON WORK AND SOCIETY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 54TH ASLIB ANNUAL CONFERENCE INFORMATION '81' FORECASTS
AND REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UK, 22-25 SEPT 81. A PHILOSOPHICAL
DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION ON WORK AND
SOCIETY. SUGGESTS THAT COMMUNICATIVE SOCIETY TENDS TO DEMOCRATISE BECAUSE OF
THE ENORMOUS EXPANSION IN THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
AND A SHIFT IN THE LABOUR FORCE SO THAT INFORMATION OPERATIVES BECOME
DOMINANT. STRESSES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT INPUT INTO MODERN PRODUCTIVE
SYSTEMS IS KNOWLEDGE. PREDICTS THAT BY THE 1990S THE WORLD WILL MOVE INTO AN
ERA OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY.
