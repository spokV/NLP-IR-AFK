TOPOGRAPHIC MAP ACQUISITION IN US ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.

PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A RECENT SURVEY OF TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP ACQUISITION IN US
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, AND DISCUSSES THE STATUS OF, AND TRENDS IN, TOPOGRAPHICAL
MAP ACQUISITION PROGRAMMES. CONCLUDES THAT THE LEVEL OF ACQUISITION OF THIS
MAPPING IS REMARKABLY LOW COMPARED TO THE STATED DEMAND FOR IT, AND THAT THE
SITUATION REGARDING FOREIGN MATERIAL IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL. IDENTIFIES THE
MAJOR COLLECTING PROBLEMS AS' LOSS OF DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS; INADEQUATE FUNDING
SUPPORT; INFLATED MAP PRICES; INCREASED PRODUCTION; AND GOVERNMENT
RESTRICTIONS. SUGGESTS THAT THESE PROBLEMS COULD BE RESOLVED BY OBTAINING
BETTER INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT THROUGH PLANNING, ORGANISED ACTION, AND
COOPERATIVE EFFORTS, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS TO
RECOGNISE THE RESOURCE VALUE OF TOPOGRAPHIC MAPPING.
