TOWARD LIBRARY LITERACY.

DEFINES WHAT IS MEANT BY 'LIBRARY LITERACY' AND SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIANS
SHOULD AIM TO EDUCATE USERS, AND IN PARTICULAR STUDENT USERS, MORE BROADLY IN
THE SKILLS NEEDED TO MAKE FULL USE OF A LIBRARY, WHICH CAN THEN BE APPLIED IN
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS, RATHER THAN TRAIN THEM IN DEPTH IN THE USE OF SPECIFIC
WORKS WITHIN THEIR OWN LIBRARY.
