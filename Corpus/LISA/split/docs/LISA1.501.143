THE SMALL ACADEMIC LIBRARY AND THE NEW COOPERATION.
     
ALTHOUGH SPIRALING COSTS AND REDUCED BUDGETS REQUIRE THAT SMALL ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES FORM CLUSTERS TO SHARE RESOURCES AND SERVICES, CONSORTIA AND LIBRARY
NETWORKS SO FAR HAVE TAKEN ONLY TENTATIVE OR SHALLOW STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION.
REAL AND MEANINGFUL STEPS CAN AND MUST BE TAKEN TO DEVELOP JOINT ACQUISITION
POLICIES, EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY INTERLIBRARY LOAN PROCEDURES, COOPERATIVE
REFERENCE SERVICES, AND DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERIODICALS. RESOURCE
UTILISATION IN THE AREAS OF TECHNICAL PROCESSES, STAFF, AND EQUIPMENT CAN BE
IMPROVED, AND LIBRARIANS NEED TO ADOPT AN ATTITUDE OF INTERDEPENDENCY AND
SHARED MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY. CLUSTERS OF 5 TO 10 LIBRARIES WITHIN A LIMITED
GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY OFFER A FEASIBLE FRAMEWORK WITH AN INDIVIDUAL IN EACH
COMMITTED TO SEEK OUT, DEVELOP, AND MAINTAIN COOPERATIVE PROGRAMMES. REPORT
