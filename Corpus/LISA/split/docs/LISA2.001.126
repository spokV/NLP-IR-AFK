MODERN PUBLIC RECORDS' SELECTION AND ACCESS.
     
REPORT OF A COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR, CHAIRMAN SIR DUNCAN
WILSON; IT WAS PRESENTED TO THE UK PARLIAMENT BY THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR, MAR
81. CONSIDERS THE KEEPING OF PUBLIC RECORDS, PRESERVATION, AND ACCESS,
PROVISIONS OF THE CURRENT PUBLIC RECORDS ACT, AND THE SITUATION REGARDING
AUDIO-VISUAL AND MACHINE-READABLE RECORDS. CONCLUDES THAT THE SYSTEM MAPPED
OUT BY THE EARLIER GRIGG REPORT IS GOOD IN ITSELF AND CAPABLE OF ADAPTATION TO
CHANGING NEEDS AND CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, BUT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED NEITHER IN
SPIRIT NOR IN LETTER. THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOCUS ON THIS
DEFICIENCY.
