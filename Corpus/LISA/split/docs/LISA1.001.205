BUSINESSMEN TRY TO STUMP LIBRARIANS.

SAN BERNADINO, CALIFORNIA, CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HOLDS A WEEKLY MEETING, THE
KOFFEE KLATCH, DESIGNED TO GIVE NEW CHAMBER MEMBERS A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT
THEIR BUSINESS AND TO BE A FORUM FOR PROGRAMMES AND SPEAKERS OF INTEREST. THE
CITY LIBRARY'S RECENT ANNUAL PRESENTATION COMPRISED THE USUAL UPDATING
PROGRAMME PLUS A DEMONSTRATION OF THE LIBRARY'S SERVICES-LIBRARY STAFF
GATHERED AS MANY QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 1/2-HOUR
PRESENTATION, TOOK THEM TO THE LIBRARY, AND RETURNED WITH ANSWERS BEFORE THE
PRESENTATION ENDED. THE KOFFEE KLATCH PARTICIPANTS WERE ASTOUNDED AND
IMPRESSED WITH THE LIBRARY'S EFFORTS AND ARRAY OF SERVICES. THE RESULT WAS A
NUMBER OF NEW LIBRARY USERS AND AN ENHANCED LIBRARY IMAGE.
