LOCAL COLLECTIONS IN BRITISH PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

THE LIBRARIAN IN CHARGE OF LOCAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS IN UK PUBLIC LIBRARIES
COLLECTIONS WILL NEED TO SCAN LOCAL PAPERS AND JOURNALS FOR REFERENCES TO
LOCAL EVENTS AND FOR REVIEWS OF BOOKS AND OTHER MATERIAL OF INTEREST. HE
SHOULD MAKE CONTACT WITH LOCAL FIRMS AND ASSOCIATIONS IN AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN
THEIR PUBLICATIONS AND SCAN THE SALES CATALOGUES OF SECOND-HAND BOOKSELLERS
AND AUCTIONEERS FOR OUT-OF-PRINT MATERIAL. THE MAIN PROBLEM FACING LOCAL
COLLECTIONS IS THE LACK OF QUALIFIED STAFF, WITHOUT WHICH THE LIBRARY CANNOT
PROVIDE A SERVICE TO THE GROWING NUMBER OF INTERESTED ENQUIRERS.
