ISORID-A CRITIQUE.

DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF, AND COMMENTS CRITICALLY ON THE PERFORMANCE OF
UNESCO'S INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM ON RESEARCH IN DOCUMENTATION
(ISORID). THE ISORID PROGRAMME WAS LAUNCHED IN THE EARLY 1970S AS AN
INTERNATIONALLY-DIMENSIONED MECHANISM FOR THE RECORDING OF PLANNED, ONGOING,
AND COMPLETED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH, AND DURING A PERIOD
OPERATED AS A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN FID AND UNESCO. CONCLUDES THAT A NUMBER OF
PROBLEMS AND SYNDROMES CHARACTERISE ISORID' MUCH RELEVANT INFORMATION IS NOT
FINDING ITS WAY INTO THE SYSTEM; THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE TIME-LAGS BETWEEN THE
RECORDING OF R&D PROJECTS AND THEIR LISTING IN THE PRINTED SERVICES;
SOPHISTICATION AND OPTIMISATION OF SYSTEMS FUNCTIONS ALONG WITH A HIGHER
DEGREE OF 'USER FRIENDLINESS' IS REQUIRED; AND A REAL USER STUDY WOULD BE
DESIRABLE.
