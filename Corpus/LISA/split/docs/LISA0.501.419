ONLINE ACCESS TO THE WORLD TRANSINDEX FILE.

A DATA BASE PROVIDING BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND THE SOURCE FOR
TRANSLATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LITERATURE FROM EASTERN EUROPE AND
ASIA INTO WESTERN LANGUAGES, WORLD TRANSINDEX INCLUDES THE INFORMATION WHICH
WAS PUBLISHED UNTIL 1977 IN THE WORLD INDEX OF SCIENTIFIC TRANSLATIONS,
TRANSATOM BULLETIN, AND BULLETIN OF TRANSLATIONS. IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN JAN 78
USING THE PASCAL SYSTEM OF THE CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE
(CNRS), WHICH PERMITS THE PUBLICATION OF INDEXES BY PHOTOCOMPOSITION AS WELL
AS ON-LINE SEARCHING. SINCE 1975, CNRS HAS HAD ON-LINE ACCESS TO ITS OWN FILE
OF TRANSLATIONS; IN 1978, SEARCHING WAS EXTENDED TO THE WORLD TRANSINDEX FILE.
