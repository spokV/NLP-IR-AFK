DEICHMAN LIBRARY AND SERIES BOOKS FOR CHILDREN.
     
IN SPRING 79 DEICHMAN LIBRARY, OSLO, STOPPED BUYING CHILDREN'S SERIES BOOKS
AND DISCARDED WORN-OUT STOCK COPIES. THEY WERE SURPRISED BY HOSTILE PUBLIC
REACTION (A SELECTION OF READERS' LETTERS TO OSLO NEWSPAPERS IS APPENDED),
HAVING REGARDED THE MOVE AS CORRECTING A LONG-STANDING MISTAKE. SINCE THE
MID-60S DEICHMAN HAD BOUGHT A FEW COPIES OF 2HARDY BOYS1 AND SIMILAR TITLES,
RECOGNISED AS SUB-STANDARD LITERATURE, BUT INTENDED TO LEAD CHILDREN TO BETTER
BOOKS AND INCREASE THE THEN INADEQUATE SELECTION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. BY
1979 THE STANDARD OF NORWEGIAN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE HAD GREATLY IMPROVED AND
THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE TITLES INCREASED. IN VIEW OF RISING BOOK PRICES,
PRIORITY WAS GIVEN TO GOOD NORWEGIAN CHILDREN'S BOOKS RATHER THAN ADULT AND
FOREIGN BOOKS IN CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENTS (EXCEPTING BOOKS FOR IMMIGRANTS).
SERIES BOOKS WERE EXCLUDED FOR A YEAR AS AN EXPERIMENT.
