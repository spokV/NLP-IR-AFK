DETERMINATION OF THE CONSERVATION TIME OF PERIODICALS FOR OPTIMAL SHELF
MAINTENANCE OF A LIBRARY.

A METHOD BASED ON A CONSTRAINED OPTIMISATION TECHNIQUE IS PRESENTED TO
DETERMINE THE TIME OF REMOVAL OF SCIENTIFIC PERIODICALS FROM THE SHELF OF A
LIBRARY. THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF MINIMISING SHELF MAINTENANCE COST ON THE
CONDITION THAT THE LOSS OF THE INFORMATION IS LESS THAN SOME SPECIFIED RATE.
THE SOLUTION OBTAINED INDICATES THAT ALL THE UTILITIES OF THE PERIODICALS
SHOULD BE EQUAL AT THE REMOVAL TIME. A GEOMETRICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE
THEORETICAL RESULT IS GIVEN. A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE IS GIVEN TO SHOW HOW THIS
TECHNIQUE IS APPLICABLE TO REAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA.
