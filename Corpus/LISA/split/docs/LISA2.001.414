CORPORATE INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN TRANSITION' CALL FOR INDUSTRY RESPONSIVENESS.
     
DATA BASE PUBLISHERS ARE IN A POSITION TO ASSIST CORPORATE USERS IN THEIR
TRANSITION INTO THE FUTURE BY PROVIDING SERVICES WHICH SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE
ON-LINE SYSTEMS WITH THE LARGER INFORMATION SYSTEMS. WHILE MANY CORPORATIONS
HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED SOPHISTICATED COMPUTERISED INFORMATION SYSTEMS, A
MAJORITY HAVE NOT. ON-LINE SYSTEMS OFFER A CORPORATION THE MEANS FOR QUICKLY
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION, AND INTRODUCE FLEXIBILITY TO CORPORATE INFORMATION
CENTRES, THUS PROVIDING THE 1ST STEP TO A FULLY INTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEM.
THE CONGRESSIONAL INFORMATION SERVICE HAS RECENTLY SURVEYED CORPORATE USERS TO
DETERMINE THEIR INFORMATION NEEDS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
