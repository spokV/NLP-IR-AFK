GUIDELINES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER-BASED CIRCULATION CONTROL SYSTEMS
IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA.
     
(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH). ANALYSES THE RESULTS OF A LITERATURE
REVIEW, QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEYS, AND INTERVIEWS AND CONCLUDES THAT NIGERIAN
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY COMPUTER-BASED CIRCULATION CONTROL SYSTEMS SHOULD BE
DEVELOPED USING AN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS CONCEPT. UNIVERSITY COMPUTER CENTRE
FACILITIES SHOULD BE USED RATHER THAN COMMERCIAL BUREAUX. GIVEN NIGERIA'S
INFRASTRUCTURE, A COMPLETELY ON-LINE REAL-TIME SYSTEM WILL NOT BE FEASIBLE
IMMEDIATELY AND AN INTERMEDIATE OFF-LINE/ON-LINE HYBRID IS SUGGESTED.
