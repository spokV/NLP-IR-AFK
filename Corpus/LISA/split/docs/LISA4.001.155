PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND LITERACY AMONGST CHILDREN AND ADULTS.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS DESPITE COMPULSORY EDUCATION FOR THE WHOLE POPULATION THERE
ARE NOW SOME 100,000 TO 400,000 (SEMI-)ILLITERATES. IN DUTCH SCHOOLS 2 METHODS
OF LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE HAVE BEEN USED, THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF
LEARNING TO RECOGNISE LISTS OF SIMPLE BUT UNRELATED WORDS AND THE FUNCTIONAL
METHOD WHICH WAS RELATED TO THE PUPIL'S ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE. WHICHEVER
METHOD IS USED, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP THE PUPIL'S ABILITY TO READ
FLUENTLY AND TO MOTIVATE HIM TO CONTINUE READING AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL. THE
DUTCH PUBLIC LIBRARY ACT OF 1975 RECOGNISED THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARY SERVICES
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN ABOLISHING LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP CHARGES UP TO THE AGE OF 18.
HOWEVER, THE ACT FAILED TO RECOGNISE THE NEED TO PROVIDE SPECIAL TYPES OF
READING MATERIALS FOR PEOPLE WITH READING DIFFICULTIES.
