THE ISSUE CONTROL IS RIDDLED WITH ERRORS.
     
STATEMENTS BY THE DANISH LIBRARIANS' UNION SHOW THAT LIBRARIANS KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT WORK IN THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS AND ISSUE DESKS, WHERE OFFICE TRAINED
STAFF, NOT LIBRARIANS, WORK; THEY THEREFORE TEND TO REJECT AUTOMATION IN THESE
AREAS. THEY ARE, ON THE OTHER HAND, TRAINED IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SERVICES AND
HENCE APPROVE OF AUTOMATION OF THESE. THE FACT IS, HOWEVER, THAT PRESENT
MANUAL ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE WORKING VERY POORLY' BOOKS ARE BEING RECALLED
WHICH ARE ALREADY RETURNED OR HAVE NEVER BEEN BORROWED. REFERS TO A NEGLECTED
REPORT OF 1979 BY A COMMITTEE OF HEADS OF ISSUE DESKS, WHICH RECOMMENDS
EXPERIMENTS WITH AUTOMATED ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS AND IN PARTICULAR SUPPORTS AN
AUTOMATIC RECALL SYSTEM. THE ISSUE DESK STAFF OF THE AUTOMATED OLSTYKKE
LIBRARY HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED POSITIVE VIEWS ON THEIR AUTOMATIC SYSTEM, VIEWS
FOR WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN REPRIMANDED BY THE LIBRARIANS' UNION.
