THE CRISIS OF DANISH SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
     
ARGUES THAT, WHEREAS THE DANISH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IS IN NO DANGER AS IT IS
SUBSIDISED THROUGH THE LIBRARY CENTRE AND ACQUIRED WIDELY BY ALL TYPES OF
LIBRARY, THE SELECTIVE, SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE GIVEN LOW PRIORITY. THE
NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY HAS TRADITIONALLY FORMED THE BASIS OF COMPILATION OF
SELECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIES, BUT WITH AUTOMATION IT IS LESS SUITABLE FOR SUBJECT
SEARCHES. GIVES EXAMPLES OF SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES WHOSE SELECTIONS ARE
NOT BASED ON THE EVALUATION OF QUALIFIED PEOPLE OF THE TOTAL PRODUCTION WITHIN
A SUBJECT. THE DANISH JOINT BIBLIOGRAPHIC COMMITTEE SET UP ON THE INSTIGATION
OF UNESCO LACKS INFLUENCE ON THE PRODUCTION OF SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
URGES THE LIBRARY CENTRE AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO PAY AS MUCH ATTENTION TO THE
ANALYTICAL, DANISH SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES AS THEY DO TO THE NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHY.
