PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION AND COOPERATIVES' A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW.
     
TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF US INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION DURING THE 20TH CENTURY.
UNSTRUCTURED COOPERATION, INDICATED BY SUCH ACTIVITIES AS THE NATIONAL UNION
CATALOG AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS (1901) AND THE 1ST INTERLIBRARY LOAN CODE
(1917), CONTINUES TODAY. SINCE WORLD WAR II, STRUCTURED COOPERATION, INCLUDING
REGIONAL NETWORKS, SPECIAL ACTIVITIES, AND MULTIPURPOSE COOPERATIVES, HAS
BECOME MORE PROMINENT. A DEFINITION OF LIBRARY COOPERATION IS OFFERED, AND
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TERMS SYSTEM, NETWORK, AND CONSORTIUM ARE EXPLORED.
PROBABLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARY COOPERATION ARE MENTIONED, INCLUDING
APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND POTENTIAL POLITICAL BENEFITS OF
MULTITYPE LIBRARY COOPERATION.
