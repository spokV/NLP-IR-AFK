AUTOMATION OF A MILITARY COMMUNICATION CENTRE.
     
IN MILITARY OPERATIONS SECURE COMMUNICATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT
INFORMATION IS TRANSFERRED SECURELY, ACCURATELY AND PROMPTLY FROM ORIGINATOR
TO ADDRESSEE. MESSAGE SWITCHING SYSTEMS HAVE IMPROVED MESSAGE AND DATA
HANDLING, THEREBY REDUCING TRANSIT TIMES TO A FEW MINUTES; HOWEVER, WITHIN
COMMUNICATION CENTRES (COMCENS), MESSAGES ARE STILL HANDLED MANUALLY AND
DELAYS OFTEN OCCUR. THE SOLUTION LIES IN THE AUTOMATION OF COMCEN ACTIVITIES
AND THE PROVISION OF DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS WITH INDIVIDUAL USERS. CONSIDERS
AUTOMATION IN TERMS OF PRESENT DAY TECHNOLOGY, AND ANALYSES THE MANUAL
OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES AND THE FUNCTIONAL MESSAGE FLOW THROUGH THE COMCEN TO
THE USERS.
