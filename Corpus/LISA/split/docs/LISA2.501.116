LIBRARIANS AND THEIR WORK AMONG READERS.
     
THERE ARE 346 PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE TURGOVISHCHE REGION. (NORTH-EAST
BULGARIA) WITH COLLECTIONS OF MORE THAN 1 1/2 MILLION VOLUMES, I.E. ABOUT 9
BOOKS PER HEAD OF THE POPULATION. EACH READER BORROWS, ON AVERAGE, ALMOST 13
BOOKS EVERY YEAR. 1/3 OF THE 171,000 INHABITANTS IN THE AREA ARE TURKS CATERED
FOR BY 47 LIBRARIANS. AFTER LITERACY COURSES AND READING ALOUD IN THE EARLY
POST-WAR YEARS, THE LIBRARIANS' EFFORTS CAN NOW BE GEARED TO ATTRACTING
READERS FROM EVERY FAMILY. LIBRARIES ARE HELPED BY CLUBS OF YOUNG FRIENDS OF
BOOKS AS WELL AS BY OTHER ORGANISATIONS. DISCUSSIONS ON SIGNIFICANT WORKS OF
LITERATURE AND OTHER EVENTS ARE ARRANGED BY THE LIBRARIES TO ENCOURAGE THE
TURKISH POPULATION TO ATTAIN A HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING AND TO TAKE PRIDE IN
THEIR SOCIALIST HOMELAND. RESULTS OF THE CONCERTED EFFORTS CAN BE DEMONSTRATED
MOST TANGIBLY IN THE CHANGED LIFE OF TURKISH WOMEN. VEILED IN THE RECENT PAST,
THEY WORK NOW, NOT ONLY IN AGRICULTURE, BU T IN MANY OTHER FIELDS. THEY ALSO
SING IN MIXED CHOIRS AND APPEAR ON THE STAGE. HOWEVER, AS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE
BULGARIAN LANGUAGE HAS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD AMONG THE TURKS IN BULGARIA, THE
READING OF BOOKS IN TURKISH HAS FOLLOWED A PROGRESSIVE DOWNWARD TREND.
