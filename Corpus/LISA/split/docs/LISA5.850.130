CENSORSHIP IN COLORADO.

SINCE JULY 81, COLORADO HAS HAD 2 CENSORSHIP STATUTES. THE 1ST, SENATE BILL
38, BROADLY ESTABLISHES FOR THE ADULT POPULATION WHAT IS OBSCENE-WHAT MAY BE
READ, SEEN OR HEARD. THE 2ND, THE RESULT OF HOUSE BILL 1310, STATES THAT NO
MATERIAL 'HARMFUL TO CHILDREN' MAY BE LOCATED WHERE CHILDREN MIGHT READ, AND
THUS EFFECTIVELY PROHIBITS ADULTS FROM THE SAME MATERIAL UNLESS BOOKSTORES BAR
ADMITTANCE TO UNDER-18S. DESPITE THE US CONSTITUTION AND BILL OF RIGHTS,
GUARANTEEING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ONSLAUGHT OF PEOPLE
CHIPPING AWAY AT THIS SOCIAL FOUNDATION. QUESTIONS THE REASONS WHY THIS SHOULD
OCCUR, AND DESCRIBES THE BOOKSELLERS' AND LIBRARIANS' ROLES IN RELATION TO THE
WOULD-BE CENSOR.
