COMPARATIVE TERMINAL REALIZATIONS WITH ALPHA-GEOMETRIC CODING.
     
IT IS CONSIDERED DESIRABLE THAT A VIDEOTEX SYSTEM SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF
TRANSMITTING BOTH HIGH AND LOW QUALITY GRAPHICS AND TERMINALS SHOULD BE ABLE
TO PRODUCE AN IMAGE FROM EITHER TYPE OF SIGNAL ACCORDING TO THE TERMINAL
DESIGN. SYSTEMS CONFIGURATIONS ARE SHOWN TO ILLUSTRATE TERMINALS OF VARIOUS
LEVELS OF SOPHISTICATION. IT IS THOUGHT THAT IN THE NEAR FUTURE THE COST
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF SOPHISTICATION WILL NOT BE GREAT. REFERENCE
IS MADE TO THE CAPABILITIES OF TELIDON SOFTWARE FLEXIBILITY.
