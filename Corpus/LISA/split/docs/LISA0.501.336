COOPERATIVE CATALOGUING SYSTEM-REGIONAL OR NATIONAL.

EXTENSIVE TREATMENT COVERING THE PRESENT SITUATION IN THEORY AND PRACTICE. THE
MAIN POINTS ARE THE GENERAL AND SPECIFIC CRITICISMS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS PUT
FORWARD BY THE GERMAN RESEARCH SOCIETY, AND THE FUNCTION, PERFORMANCE AND
COSTS OF A NATIONAL COOPERATIVE SYSTEM COMPARED WITH 7 INDEPENDENT REGIONAL
CATALOGUING SYSTEMS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT WHILE A NATIONAL SYSTEM WOULD OFFER
MANY TECHNICAL AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ADVANTAGES, THERE IS NO NATIONAL CONSENSUS
FOR ITS ESTABLISHMENT.
