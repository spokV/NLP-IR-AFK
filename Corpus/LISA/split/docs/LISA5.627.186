QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF THE REFERENCE PROCESS.

THE QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF THE REFERENCE PROCESS IS DISCUSSED. A
DISTINCTION IS MADE BETWEEN THE BEHAVIOURAL OUTCOMES OF THE REFERENCE PROCESS,
AND THE CAUSAL FACTORS THAT INHIBIT THE DELIVERY OF REFERENCE SERVICE. DATA
ARE PRESENTED ON 16 LIBRARIES THAT PARTICIPATED IN A NATIONAL STUDY OF LIBRARY
ECONOMICS. DATA ON BEHAVIOURAL AND CAUSAL ASPECTS ARE COLLECTED AND ANALYSED
SEPARATELY; GROUP OR COMPOSITE VALUES FOR THE PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS ARE
PRESENTED. THESE ARE TRANSFORMED TO PROVIDE INDEPENDENT MEASURES OF THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE STAFF, THE COLLECTION, AND THE PATRONS. GROUP VALUES,
TOGETHER WITH THE RANGE AND MEDIANS, ARE PRESENTED. THE QUESTION OF HOW THE
LIBRARIAN'S PERCEPTION OF SUCCESS IS RELATED TO THE PATRON'S PERCEPTION, AND
TO THE VALIDITY OF THE ANSWERS PROVIDED, IS DISCUSSED BRIEFLY.
