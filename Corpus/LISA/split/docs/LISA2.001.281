BETTER MANAGEMENT NEEDED IN AUTOMATING THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY.
     
THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 1981, THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER WILL SPEND ABOUT $24
MILLION TO DEVELOP NEW COMPUTER-BASED SYSTEMS, EVALUATE AND ACQUIRE READY-MADE
SYSTEMS, AND OPERATE THEM IN SUPPORT OF THE US COURTS. THESE SYSTEMS WILL NOT
REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL UNTIL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
PROBLEMS AND MANAGEMENT PLANNING, COORDINATION, AND CONTROL PROBLEMS ARE
RESOLVED. GAO RECOMMENDS THAT THE DIRECTOR, FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER AND THE
DIRECTOR, ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE US COURTS WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE THE
PLANNING, MANAGEMENT, AND CONTROL OF DATA PROCESSING OPERATIONS.
