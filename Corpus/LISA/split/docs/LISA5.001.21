LIBRARIES IN THE REPUBLIC OF MALI.

BEFORE POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE, EDUCATION AND LIBRARIES WERE DOMINATED BY 2
COLONIAL POWERS, THE ARABS IN THE 11TH CENTURY AND THE FRENCH IN THE 19TH.
SINCE INDEPENDENCE IN 1960 EDUCATION AND LIBRARIES HAVE DEVELOPED TO TRY AND
OVERCOME ILLITERACY. THE FORMER LIBRARY OF THE FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR BLACK
AFRICA BECAME THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF THE NEW REPUBLIC OF MALI, RESPONSIBLE
FOR COLLECTION OF MATERIAL AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE NATIONAL POLICY FOR
LIBRARIES. LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN SCHOOLS AND IN INSTITUTIONS FOR
HIGHER EDUCATION AND RESEARCH. BOOK PRODUCTION IN THE VARIOUS NATIONAL
LANGUAGES IS BEING EXPANDED. THERE ARE AT PRESENT A TOTAL OF 46 PUBLIC
LIBRARIES WITH STOCKS OF BETWEEN 600-1,000 ITEMS FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN.
THERE ARE ALSO LIBRARIES IN THE CULTURAL CENTRES OF FOREIGN EMBASSIES, SOME
PRIVATE ROMAN CATHOLIC LIBRARIES AND THE LIBRARIES OF INTERNATIONAL
ORGANISATIONS.
