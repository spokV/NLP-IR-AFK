THE PENNSYLVANIA UNION LIST OF SERIALS INITIAL DEVELOPMENT.
     
THE PENNSYLVANIA UNION LIST OF SERIALS IS A NEW PROJECT FUNDED BY THE STATE
LIBRARY OF PENNSYLVANIA. IN 1979 IT AWARDED THE PITTSBURGH REGIONAL LIBRARY
CENTER $99,304 IN LSCA TITLE III FUNDS FOR FIRST YEAR DEVELOPMENT OF A
STATEWIDE UNION LIST WHICH WILL BE ON-LINE THROUGH OCLC. PRLC'S HISTORY OF
WORKING WITH ON-LINE UNION LISTS IS REVIEWED, AND PLANS FOR THE FIRST YEAR ARE
DESCRIBED. INITIALLY, THERE WILL BE CONCENTRATION ON SYSTEM DESIGN. AT THE
SAME TIME, A CORE LIST OF APPROXIMATELY 2,000 TITLES WILL BE SELECTED, AS WILL
THE LIBRARIES TO PARTICIPATE DURING 1979-1980. FUTURE PLANS WILL CONSIDER SOME
DECENTRALISATION.
