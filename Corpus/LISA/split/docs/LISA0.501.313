INTERLIBRARY BORROWING' COSTS AND BENEFITS.

AN ASSESSMENT IS NEEDED OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE COST OF OBTAINING
MATERIAL ON INTERLIBRARY LOAN. THE MAIN INTERNAL LIBRARY RESOURCE INVOLVED IS
STAFF TIME, WHICH MUST BE USED EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. DISCUSSES COSTS
PER LOAN, CHARGES FOR SERVICE, AND DOCUMENT DELIVERY. CONCLUDES THAT LIBRARIES
SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE A COST-EFFECTIVE INTERLENDING SERVICE BY
CONCENTRATING ON ITEMS WHICH USERS REALLY NEED AND BY ASSESSING CAREFULLY WHEN
INTERLOANS ARE MOST BENEFICIAL. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSESS
THE EFFECTS OF NEW PROCEDURES AND TECHNOLOGIES AT LOCAL LEVEL ON THE SCHOLARLY
AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AS A WHOLE.
