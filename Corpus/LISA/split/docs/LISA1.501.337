INTERLIBRARY LENDING' A SOUTH-EAST ASIAN PERSPECTIVE.
     
EDITED VERSION OF A PAPER GIVEN TO THE IFLA SECTION ON INTERLENDING AT THE
IFLA GENERAL CONFERENCE, MANILA, THE PHILIPPINES, AUG 80. SURVEYS INTERLENDING
IN THE COUNTRIES WHICH COMPRISE THE CONSORTIUM OF NATIONAL LIBRARIES AND
DOCUMENTATION CENTRES, SOUTH-EAST ASIA-INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, THE PHILIPPINES,
SINGAPORE AND THAILAND. A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY REVEALED THAT THE VOLUME OF
INTERLENDING VARIED GREATLY BETWEEN THESE COUNTRIES AND WAS GENERALLY LOW.
MANY MORE INTERLIBRARY LOAN REQUESTS WERE SENT ABROAD THAN WERE RECEIVED. ONLY
A FEW LIBRARIES HAD TELEPHONE AND TELEX LINKS, BUT MANY HAD REPROGRAPHIC
EQUIPMENT. REQUESTS WERE SENT MAINLY TO SUBJECT SPECIALIST LIBRARIES, AND
UNION CATALOGUES AND CENTRAL COLLECTIONS WERE LESS USED. CHARGES WERE MINIMAL.
STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STATISTICS.
THIS IS 1 FUNCTION OF NATIONAL INTERLENDING CENTRES, WHICH SHOULD BE
ESTABLISHED AS INDEPENDENT UNITS IN ALL COUN TRIES.
