A STUDY OF THE INTERACTION IN BOOK SELECTION BETWEEN PROVINCIAL LIBRARY
SYSTEMS AND THEIR AFFILIATED PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN SOUTH AFRICA.

(M.A. THESIS). EXAMINED CURRENT METHODS OF BOOK SELECTION IN RURAL, PROVINCIAL
LIBRARIES, IN SOUTH AFRICA, WITH A VIEW TO ESTABLISHING WHETHER THEY ARE THE
MOST EFFECTIVE POSSIBLE. RESULTS SHOWED THAT RELATIVELY LITTLE CHANGE HAD
TAKEN PLACE IN THE ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES OF THESE LIBRARIES AND THEIR BOOK
SELECTION METHODS SINCE THEIR INCEPTION AND THAT INVOLVEMENT OF LOCAL
LIBRARIANS IN BOOK SELECTION WAS NEGLIGIBLE. RURAL LIBRARIES IN COUNTRIES
OUTSIDE SOUTH AFRICA WERE REVIEWED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A MODEL AGAINST WHICH TO
MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF SOUTH AFRICAN LIBRARIES.
