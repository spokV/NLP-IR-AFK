DATA HANDLING FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY' AN OVERVIEW AND SOURCEBOOK.

A GUIDEBOOK CONCERNED WITH PUBLISHING NUMERICAL SCIENTIFIC DATA, GAINING
ACCESS TO IT AND ASCERTAINING ITS RELIABILITY. IT IS AIMED AT PRODUCERS AND
USERS OF DATA AS WELL AS INFORMATION SPECIALISTS INCREASINGLY CALLED UPON TO
PROVIDE NUMERICAL DATA TO SCIENTIFIC USERS. PAPERS COVER ASPECTS OF THE
GENERATION, PUBLISHING, ABSTRACTING, COLLECTION, EVALUATION, REPACKAGING,
DISSEMINATION AND APPLICATION OF DATA. IN THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES DATA ARE
USUALLY SUFFICIENTLY WELL DEFINED TO BE CLEARLY SEPARABLE FROM INTERPRETATION
BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH BIOLOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL SCIENCES SO SPECIAL
ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO DATA HANDLING IN THESE SUBJECTS.
