USER AND LIBRARIAN IN CONVERSATION, PT. 1.

AN INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT INTO THE BEHAVIOUR OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIANS
WHEN HANDLING READERS' ENQUIRIES IN THE ADULT LENDING DEPARTMENT OF
NEUBRANDENBERG MUNICIPAL AND DISTRICT LIBRARY, WITH THE INTENTION OF ASSESSING
THE USER-STAFF RELATIONSHIP IN THE CONTEXT OF SOCIAL COMMUNICATION. CHECKS
WERE MADE ON THE FREQUENCY OF USERS' VISITS DURING DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE
DAY TO SEE WHETHER THE LIBRARIAN HAD SUFFICIENT TIME FOR ADVISORY WORK, WHICH
WAS IN FACT THE CASE FOR ABOUT 80% OF THE TIME. IT IS DIFFICULT BUT NECESSARY
TO MAKE A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THIS TYPE OF WORK IN ORDER TO MAKE A
COMPARISON OF RESULTS.
