LINGUISTIC SUPPORT IN AUTOMATED LIBRARY SYSTEMS.

AIMS TO SHOW THE CURRENT POSITION AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF LINGUISTIC
SUPPORT, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE STATE AUTOMATED SYSTEM OF SCIENTIFIC
AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION (GASNTI). THE CONTENT AND STRUCTURE OF LINGUISTIC
SUPPORT IS DEFINED BY THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBRARY SERVICE AND THE
INFORMATION INVOLVED. IN PRACTICE, LINGUISTIC SUPPORT HAS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF
NOT ONLY THE SUBJECT CONTENT BUT ALSO A RANGE OF EXTERNAL FEATURES INCLUDING
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION. ITS APPLICATION IN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS CAN BE SEEN
AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL IN UNISIST, AS WELL AS AT NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL.
