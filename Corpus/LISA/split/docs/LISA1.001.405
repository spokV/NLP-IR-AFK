METHOD FOR GENERATING A CHEMICAL REACTION INDEX FOR STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF
INFORMATION.

A NEW METHOD FOR INDEXING CHEMICAL REACTIONS IS DESCRIBED. THE CALCULATION OF
A REACTION CONNECTIVITY INDEX RESULTS IN A UNIQUE NUMBER. THIS NUMBER DOES NOT
PROVIDE HIERARCHICAL OR RELATIONAL INFORMATION. IT ENCODES THE CONCEPT OF THE
REACTION PROCESS IN A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER WHICH IS SUGGESTED FOR USE, MUCH AS
THE CAS REGISTRY NUMBER IS USED, TO OPTIMISE EASE OF STORAGE, MANIPULATION,
AND RETRIEVAL FROM LARGE COMPUTER FILES.
