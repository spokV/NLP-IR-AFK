REPORT OF AN ANALYTICAL STUDY OF 2LIBRARY LITERATURE1 AND 2LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SCIENCE ABSTRACTS1. THE MAIN CRITERIA USED WERE CURRENCY OF

FOR EACH PERIODICAL COMPARED. ADDITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS WERE ALSO COMPARED'

OF INDEXES, AND PRICE. THE FINAL CONCLUSION DRAWN WAS THAT THE 2 PERIODICALS
ARE LARGELY SIMILAR APART FROM VARIATIONS IN INDEX PROVISION, CLASSIFICATION
