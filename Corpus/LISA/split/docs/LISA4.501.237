DATA/DIRECT INFORMATION-DATA DOCUMENTATION.
     
DATA IS ALSO DESCRIBED AS NON-BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION; QUANTITATIVE DATA OR
TEXTUAL DATA. HANDLING, TYPES AND SOURCES OF SUCH DATA ARE DISCUSSED, WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION. DATA INDEXING IN

INDICATORS. EXAMPLES JUSTIFY THE NECESSITY OF STRENGTHENING THE LINK BETWEEN
BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND DATA INFORMATION ACTIVITIES.
