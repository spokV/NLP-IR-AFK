COMPUTER STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES IN PATENTS. 3.
CHEMICAL GRAMMARS AND THEIR ROLE IN THE MANIPULATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES.
     
A SIMPLE TOPOLOGICAL CHEMICAL GRAMMAR IS DEVELOPED, AND ITS POSSIBLE
APPLICATIONS TO THE COMPUTER MANIPULATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES ARE
DISCUSSED. THE GENERATIVE AND RECOGNITIVE CAPABILITIES OF THE GRAMMAR ARE
ILLUSTRATED BY EXAMPLES. CONCLUDES BY IDENTIFYING THE ROLE OF SUCH
CAPABILITIES IN A GENERIC (MARKUSH) STRUCTURE SEARCH SYSTEM.
