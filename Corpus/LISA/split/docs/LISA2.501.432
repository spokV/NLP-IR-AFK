CAIRS-A COMPUTER ASSISTED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.
     
A FLEXIBLE LOW COST MINICOMPUTER BASED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IS
DESCRIBED. CAIRS (COMPUTER ASSISTED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM) ALLOWS
INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF DOCUMENTS, TEXT, RECORDS OR ABSTRACTS TO BE STORED
IN A COMPUTER DATA BASE. THE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN RTL2, A HIGH LEVEL
TRANSPORTABLE COMPUTER LANGUAGE, WHICH ALLOWS CAIRS TO RUN ON MOST POPULAR
MINICOMPUTERS. DATA ENTRY IS CARRIED OUT USING A DIRECT KEY TO DISC FACILITY,
WITH FORMATTED VISUAL DISPLAY SCREENS BEING PRESENTED TO SPEED INPUT. THE
ADVANTAGES OF INPUT VALIDATION AND EFFICIENT EDITING OF ENTERED MATERIAL ARE
FULLY EXPLOITED, AND AN INTERACTIVE THESAURUS MAY ALSO BE USED. DATA ON CAIRS
CAN BE INDEXED USING CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS OR HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURES.
ALTERNATIVELY, KEYWORD INDEXING OF THE AUTOMATIC, SEMI-AUTOMATIC OR MANUAL
TYPE MAY BE APPLIED, PLUS EITHER A FREE OR CONTROLLED LANGUAGE VOCABULARY.
SEARCHING PROCEEDS VIA INVERTED FILE AND SER IAL (STRING) SEARCH FUNCTIONS,
ALTHOUGH A VARIETY OF SPECIALISED TASKS ALLOW BULLETINS, LISTS AND CATALOGUES
TO BE PRODUCED. CAIRS IS DESIGNED TO REPLACE ANY APPLICATIONS WHERE MANUAL
CARD INDEX FILING SYSTEMS ARE EMPLOYED, AND IS AVAILABLE AS BOTH A SOFTWARE
SYSTEM OR AS A COMPLETE SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PACKAGE.
