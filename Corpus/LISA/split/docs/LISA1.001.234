LIBRARIES AND VILLAGE DEVELOPMENT IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA.

ATTEMPTS TO OUTLINE POSSIBLE MODELS FOR LIBRARIES WHICH MIGHT STRENGTHEN THEIR
CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL VILLAGES IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA.
DISCUSSES 2 PARTICULAR MODELS-THE LIBRARY EXTENSION MODEL (THE TAKING OF
EXISTING LIBRARY SERVICES INTO THE COMMUNITY); AND THE VILLAGE INFORMATION
CENTRE MODEL (AN INFORMATION ORGANISATION LOCATED IN A GEOGRAPHIC AREA
SPECIFICALLY SET UP TO ASSIST VILLAGERS AND PROFESSIONAL FIELDWORKERS TO
DEVELOP THAT PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA).
