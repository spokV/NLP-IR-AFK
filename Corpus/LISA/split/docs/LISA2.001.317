PRELIMINARY EVALUATION OF A SELECTIVE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION SERVICE IN
AN AGRICULTURE LIBRARY.
     
DESCRIBES THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF A SMALL SCALE MANUAL CURRENT
AWARENESS SERVICE AT A BRAZILIAN AGRICULTURE LIBRARY, BIBLIOTECA ESTADUAL DE
AGRICULTURA DO PARANA. THE SERVICE WAS LIMITED TO PERIODICALS OVER A 1 YEAR
PERIOD. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF PROCEDURES FOR CONSTRUCTING USER PROFILES,
ANALYSIS OF LITERATURE, AND NOTIFICATION. TO DATE, RELEVANCE IS ABOUT 70%, BUT
AN INITIAL LACK OF COOPERATION FROM USERS MAKES ACCURATE ASSESSMENT DIFFICULT.
A STUDY OF PERIODICAL USAGE IS BEING PLANNED.
