THE ADVANCEMENT OF READING AT WORK.
     
THE FACTORY LIBRARY SHOULD PROVIDE LITERATURE FOR ALL STAFF, ESPECIALLY THE
WORKERS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE READING HABITS
OF DIFFERENT SOCIAL GROUPS; WORKERS PROBABLY COMPRISE MORE THAN 1/8 BUT LESS
THEN 1/2 OF A FACTORY LIBRARY'S READERS. THE FACTORY LIBRARY IS THE LIBRARY
MOST LIKELY TO PROMOTE READING AMONG THE WORKING CLASSES. IN FACTORY
LIBRARIES, AS OPPOSED TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THERE ARE MORE ADULT READERS THAN
TEENAGE READERS AND MORE MALE READERS THAN FEMALE. MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT
ADULTS NEED TO READ MORE THAN THE YOUNG AND THAT THE WORKERS WHO DO READ, EVEN
IF ONLY LIGHT LITERATURE, WILL HAVE MORE ACTIVE AND COMMUNICATIVE
PERSONALITIES THAN NON-READERS AND MAKE A LARGER CONTRIBUTION TO PRODUCTIVITY.
