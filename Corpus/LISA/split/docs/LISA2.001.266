DESCRIBES THE PROVINCIAL LIBRARY SYSTEM CONCEPT IN THE CANADIAN CONTEXT AND
INDICATES ITS POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH. THE SYSTEM HAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO
NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES. IT MAY BE CALLED A DISTRIBUTED-INFORMATION-SYSTEM IN
AS MUCH AS ITS COMPONENTS, THE LOCAL LIBRARIES, ARE HIGHLY VIABLE AND
REGULARLY RETRIEVE, PROCESS, AND DELIVER INFORMATION. LOCAL LIBRARY
COOPERATIVE PROJECTS HAVE STRENGTHENED THE SYSTEM. REGIONAL SYSTEMS WITHIN THE
PROVINCIAL SYSTEM HAVE PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE IN STRENGTHENING RESOURCES,
IMPROVING ACCESSIBILITY, AND PERFORMING CENTRAL FUNCTIONS. THE WHOLE SYSTEM
HAS PROVED TO BE HIGHLY FLEXIBLE, RESPONSIVE, AND ABLE TO PROVIDE QUALITY
SERVICES AT RELATIVELY LOW COST.
