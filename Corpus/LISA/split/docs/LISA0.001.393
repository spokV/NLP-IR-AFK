AUTOMATED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WITH DIRECT ACCESS TO INFORMATION.
(FOREIGN PRESS MATERIALS).

DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE PRINCIPLES OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND
POINTS OUT THAT ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS 5 TO 10 TIMES FASTER THAN
MANUAL RETRIEVAL. LISTS THE DISADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE INFORMATION SYSTEMS: THE
BUILDING OF DATA BASES IS A COMPLEX TASK; DUPLICATION OF INFORMATION IS
UNAVOIDABLE; THE COSTS ARE HIGH AND STAFF MUST BE TRAINED TO USE THESE
SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, STAFF MUST LEARN A NUMBER OF 'COMMAND LANGUAGES' BECAUSE
OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF ON-LINE SYSTEMS AVAILABLE. THIS PROBLEM COULD PERHAPS
BE OVERCOME BY USING 'TRANSPARENT SYSTEMS' WHICH FUNCTION AS AN INTERFACE, OR
'A TRANSLATOR', BETWEEN THE SEARCHER AND THE MACHINE. IN THIS CASE THE
SEARCHER WOULD ONLY NEED ONE COMMAND LANGUAGE.
