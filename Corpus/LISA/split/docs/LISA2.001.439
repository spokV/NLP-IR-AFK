THE INFLUENCE OF COMPUTERISED IUD-DATABASES ON THE STRUCTURE OF SERVICE
PROGRAMMES IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
     
SINCE THE 1970S ON-LINE DATA BASES COVERING A VARIETY OF SUBJECTS HAVE STARTED
TO BE INSTALLED IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. THESE LIBRARIES SHOULD BE CONSIDERING
HOW DATA BASES CAN BE USED NOW AND IN THE FUTURE TO IMPROVE THEIR SERVICE
PROGRAMME STRUCTURE. MOST DATA BASES CANNOT BE USED DIRECTLY BY LIBRARY USERS
AND SPECIALLY TRAINED STAFF ARE NECESSARY. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE MASSIVE RANGE OF INFORMATION SERVICES NOW AVAILABLE.
THE INTRODUCTION OF DATA BASES PROVIDING IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO LITERATURE
REFERENCES MEANS THAT METHODS OF INCREASING THE SPEED OF ACCESS TO THE
LITERATURE ITSELF SHOULD ALSO BE DEVELOPED.
