THE PURCHASING KEY' A METHOD FOR PROGRAMMING AND CONTROLLING COLLECTIVE
PURCHASING.

SINCE THE 1960S THE CENTRALISATION OF STOCK PROCESSING AND ADVISORY WORK ON
BOOK SELECTION HAS DEMANDED RATIONALISATION METHODS IN LIBRARY ORGANISATION.
THE USE OF PURCHASING KEY CODES IN DRESDEN'S LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARY SYSTEM IS
DESCRIBED. IN A COLLECTIVE PURCHASING DECISION EACH PARTICIPANT CAN USE THE
KEY TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THE WHOLE NETWORK; THUS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR LITERATURE PROVISION BECOMES GREATER. USING A KEY ALSO ENSURES BALANCED
STOCK PROPORTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE NETWORK AND TAKES INTO ACCOUNT DEMANDS
FOR TIME SAVING AND FOR IMPROVED STOCK QUALITY, THUS OFFERING AN OPTIMAL
SOLUTION FOR UNIFYING STOCKS IN A TERRITORIAL NETWORK.
