ATTAINABLE BENEFITS OF THE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM ARE NOT BEING
REALIZED.
     
STATES THAT USERS OF MEDICAID MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS SHOULD BE ABLE TO
ADMINISTER THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAMME MORE EFFICIENTLY, EFFECTIVELY, AND
ECONOMICALLY. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE (HEW) PAYS
STATES 90% OF THE COST TO DEVELOP SUCH SYSTEMS AND 75% OF THE COST TO OPERATE
THEM, INSTEAD OF THE USUAL 50% COST SHARING. HEW HAS DETERMINED THAT 17 STATES
HAVE SYSTEMS WHICH MEET LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS; GAO REVIEWED
3 OF THEM. NEITHER THE STATES NOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE REALISING ALL
BENEFITS EXPECTED.
