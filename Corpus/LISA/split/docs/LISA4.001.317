NO GRANDFATHER CLAUSE: REAPPRAISING ACCESSIONED RECORDS.
     
EVERY PUBLIC RECORDS REPOSITORY HAS ON ITS SHELVES RECORDS WHICH, IF OFFERED
TODAY, WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE, AND YET SHELF SPACE IS STILL PROVIDED FOR THEM.
FOR SUCH RECORDS THERE SHOULD BE NO 'GRANDFATHER CLAUSE'. DISCUSSES THE
REASONS FOR THE KEEPING OF RECORDS OF QUESTIONABLE VALUE, AND SUGGESTS A
REAPPRAISAL PROCEDURE, WITH AN INTERVAL OF REAPPRAISAL OF PERHAPS 20 TO 30
YEARS. DISCUSSES APPRAISAL METHODS, STRESSING THE CARE THAT MUST BE TAKEN IF
UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT RECORDS ARE NOT TO BE DESTROYED.
