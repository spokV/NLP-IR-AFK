BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING DIVISION (IN SWEDISH).
     
THE BLLD WAS FORMED IN 1973 THROUGH THE AMALGAMATION OF THE NATIONAL CENTRAL
LIBRARY AND THE NATIONAL LENDING LIBRARY FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THE AIM
IS THAT ALMOST ALL ORDERS FROM OTHER LIBRARIES SHALL BE FULFILLED FROM THE
LIBRARY'S OWN STOCK AND PROCESSED THE SAME DAY. THIS NECESSITATES A
COMPREHENSIVE ACQUISITION POLICY, EFFICIENT WORK ROUTINES, AND CENTRAL
LOCATION, AT BOSTON SPA. ITS GIFT & EXCHANGE SECTION SERVES A USEFUL FUNCTION
AS DEPOSIT FOR WITHDRAWN MATERIAL FROM OTHER LIBRARIES. A MUSIC COLLECTION IS
BEING BUILT UP. THE LARGEST DEPARTMENTS ARE THOSE FOR SERIALS AND BOOKS, AND
TOTAL STOCK COMPRISES 4 MILLION VOLUMES AND 2.5 MILLION DOCUMENTS OR FICHES.
ALL PERIODICALS, BUT MAINLY ENGLISH LANGUAGE MONOGRAPHS ONLY, ARE ACQUIRED.
SPECIAL ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO COVERAGE OF RUSSIAN SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
PUBLICATIONS. DESCRIBES THE SELECTION METHODS. THE ROUTINES ARE SIMPLE AND FEW
OF THE STAFF HAVE HIGHER EDUCATION, EMPHASIS BEI NG ON ADMINISTRATIVE SKILLS.
THE SERVICES PAY FOR THEMSELVES OVERALL AND THE BUDGET IS GENEROUS. USE OF
BACK-UP LIBRARIES IS MADE, MOSTLY THE LEGAL DEPOSIT LIBRARIES. VARIOUS
CATALOGUES ARE AVAILABLE, INCLUDING THE UNION CATALOGUE OF BOOKS LISTING THE
HOLDINGS OF BLLD AND SOME OTHER LIBRARIES.
