THE DIPLOMA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP: A CRITICAL STUDY.
     
REPLY TO AN ARTICLE IN OPEN 12 (9) SEPT 80, 397-404 (SEE 81/1865) IN WHICH
PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION FOR THE DIPLOMA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE
NETHERLANDS WAS CRITICISED FOR THE LACK OF A PRACTICAL BASE. HOWEVER, STUDENTS
FOLLOWING THE COURSE IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP AT THE P.A. TIELE SCHOOL OF
LIBRIANSHIP IN THE HAGUE RECEIVE LECTURES FROM PRACTISING ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS
AND THE SYLLABUS IS REVIEWED ANNUALLY IN CONSULTATION WITH STUDENTS AND WITH
STAFF FROM ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. IN ADDITION THE VARIETY OF POSTS IN ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES OPEN TO STUDENTS COMPLETING THE COURSE MAKES IT IMPRACTICAL TO SUIT
THE SYLLABUS TO A SINGLE TYPE OF LIBRARY. IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT TOO LITTLE IS
KNOWN ABOUT THE COURSE BY PRACTISING LIBRARIANS.
