BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL' A BRITISH VIEW.
     
A FAMILIAR AND CONTINUING PROBLEM IN UK LIBRARIES IS THE UNDERUTILISATION OF

GROWTH OF COOPERATIVE REGIONAL NETWORKS; SUGGESTS THAT THE EMERGING SYSTEM MAY
FORM THE BASE FOR THE MANIPULATION AND SHARING OF FULL MICROFORM ANALYTICS;
AND OFFERS SOME PROVOCATIVE COMMENTS ON RECENT US EFFORTS TOWARD PROVIDING
MICROFORMS WITH FULL BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION.
