HYSTERIA IS UNNECESSARY' OBSERVATIONS FROM A STUDY TOUR OF THE USA.

THE TOUR WAS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH PLANS FOR DEVELOPING GERMAN INFORMATION
AND DOCUMENTATION SERVICES. MANY US DEVELOPMENTS COULD NOT BE TRANSFERRED
DIRECTLY TO EUROPE SINCE THEY WOULD BE UNSUITABLE FOR A SMALL MARKET. IN THE
USA A WIDE RANGE OF INSTITUTIONS IS INVOLVED IN INFORMATION DISSEMINATION, IN
CONTRAST WITH THE SMALLER, GOVERNMENT-BASED ORGANISATION PLANNED FOR WEST
GERMANY. THE US ECONOMIC CLIMATE LENDS ITSELF TO EXPERIMENT BETTER THAN THE
EUROPEAN. THE US MARKET FOR LITERATURE REFERENCE DATA BASES HAS REACHED
SATURATION POINT AND THE MAIN GROWTH AREAS ARE IN FACTOGRAPHIC AND FULL TEXT
DATA BASES. CURRENT TRENDS ARE AGAINST THE SUPERMARKET APPROACH TO SELLING. A
WIDE RANGE OF TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS ARE BEING CARRIED OUT. MANY PEOPLE
CONSIDER THAT THE CLOSE LINK WITH LIBRARIES IS RETURNING INFORMATION SCIENCE
DEVELOPMENT.
