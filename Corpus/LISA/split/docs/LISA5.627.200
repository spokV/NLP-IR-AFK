THE SUITABILITY OF THE CARIBBEAN SITUATION FOR ESTABLISHING LIBRARY NETWORKS.

TRANSLATED BY CARLOS GIL. ANALYSES THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCCESSFULLY
IMPLEMENTING AUTOMATED LIBRARY NETWORKS IN THE CARIBBEAN, IN RELATION TO THE
ACTUAL SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. THE DISCUSSION COVERS THE
ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT; THE NEED FOR AND LIKELIHOOD OF
COOPERATION AMONG THE CARIBBEAN STATES; THE PROBABLE IMPACT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY
IMPORTED FROM THE DEVELOPED WORLD; AND THE ABILITY OF CARIBBEAN LIBRARIES TO
IMPLEMENT AUTOMATED PROGRAMMES AND ADAPT TO THEM. CONCLUDES THAT THE OCLC TYPE
NETWORK MODEL IS NOT SUITABLE FOR THE CARIBBEAN SITUATION, REQUIRING TOO GREAT
AN INVESTMENT WITHOUT CONCRETE EVIDENCE THAT THE PHYSICAL, POLITICAL AND
SOCIAL OBSTACLES TO COOPERATION COULD BE OVERCOME. RECOMMENDS INSTEAD A
DETAILED INVESTIGATION OF LIBRARY AND TELECOMMUNICATION RESOURCES, WITH A VIEW
TO DEVELOPING AN INDIGENOUS NETWORK.
