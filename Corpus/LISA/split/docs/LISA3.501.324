SERIALS CONTROL.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB CONFERENCE INFORMATION '81' FORECASTS AND
REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UK, 22-25 SEPT 81. SERIALS CONTROL IS THROUGHT
TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF LIBRARY HOUSEKEEPING PROCESSES TO AUTOMATE. NO
AUTOMATED SERIALS CONTROL SYSTEM HAS YET BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE
COST-EFFECTIVE. MINICOMPUTER BASED SYSTEMS SHOW PROMISE OF MORE EFFICIENT
OPERATION. STUDIES AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY HAVE SHOWN THE FEASIBILITY OF
AUTOMATED SERIALS CHECK-IN BEING ACHIEVED FASTER THAN IS POSSIBLE MANUALLY.
FURTHER STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE
SYSTEM TO BE COST-EFFECTIVE. PREDICTION OF THE ARRIVAL DATE FOR IRREGULAR
SERIALS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM. THE DIFFICULTIES (AND EXPENSE) OF UPDATING FILES
IN REAL-TIME REPRESENTS ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR WHICH A TENTATIVE SOLUTION IS
PROPOSED. THE NEED TO IMPROVE THE USER INTERFACE IS EMPHASISED AND THIS IS ONE
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MATTERS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
