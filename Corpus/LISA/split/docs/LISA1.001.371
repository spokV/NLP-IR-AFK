THE USE OF THE BLAISE EDITOR AT GARNETT COLLEGE LIBRARY.

GARNETT COLLEGE IS THE BRITISH LIBRARY'S ONLY CUSTOMER TO DEDICATE ITS ENTIRE
CATALOGUING OPERATION TO ON-LINE WORKING AND IS CONSEQUENTLY DEPENDENT ON THE
FACILITIES OFFERED BY THE BLAISE EDITOR. OUTLINES THE CATALOGUING PROCEDURE AT
THE COLLEGE, MENTIONING WEAKNESSES IN EDITOR'S CONCEPTION, THOSE FACILITIES
THAT ARE OF LITTLE PRACTICAL VALUE, ITS ADVANTAGES, AND COST. CONCLUDES THAT
ON-LINE INPUT VIA EDITOR IS AN EFFICIENT AND ECONOMIC MEANS OF PRODUCTION FOR
A COMPUTER-BASED CATALOGUE.
