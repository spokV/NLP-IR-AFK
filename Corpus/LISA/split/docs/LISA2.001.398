A CLASSIFICATION FOR LOCAL COLLECTIONS' AN APPEAL FOR COOPERATION.
     
IN COOPERATION WITH THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE, THE WORKING GROUP FOR
SPECIAL LIBRARIES HAS CONSULTED WITH ALL CONCERNED WITH LOCAL COLLECTIONS TO
PRODUCE A CLASSIFICATION SCHEME WHICH COULD BE USED THROUGHOUT WEST GERMANY.
THERE WILL BE A COMMON CORE TO THE SCHEME, BUT SUFFICIENT FLEXIBILITY TO
ACCOMODATE SPECIAL FACTORS, SUCH AS MOUNTAINOUS OR COASTAL AREAS. THE SCHEME
IS OUTLINED IN TABULAR FORM AND SHOWS 4 BROAD CATEGORIES DEVOTED TO HISTORY,
TOPOGRAPHY, ADMINISTRATION, BIOGRAPHIES AND FAMILY HISTORIES.
