THE IMPACT OF USER FRUSTRATION OF HUMANITIES RESEARCH.

REPORTS ON A SURVEY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE CONSEQUENCE OF USER
FRUSTRATION AMONG HUMANITIES FACULTIES CAUSED BY COLLECTION INADEQUACY AT
VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND STATE UNIVERSITY. RESULTS INDICATE THAT
SUCH FRUSTRATION DOES EXIST, BUT THE LACK OF A STRONG HUMANITIES COLLECTION IS
NOT DEEMED TO BE AN UNSURMOUNTABLE IMPEDIMENT TO RESEARCH. THE FREEDOM AND
ENCOURAGEMENT TO TRAVEL TO PRIMARY SOURCES AND A COMFORTABLE WORK ENVIRONMENT
WITH EFFICIENT, EFFECTIVE SERVICES IS MOST IMPORTANT.
