METHODS OF REFERENCE IN CASSIODORUS.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. THE 2PSALM COMMENTARY, 1BY THE 6TH-CENTURY LATIN CHURCH
FATHER, CASSIODORUS, USED A TYPE OF FORMAT CREATED BY THE AUTHOR HIMSELF-ONE
NEVER TO BE USED AGAIN IN THE HISTORY OF THE MEDIAEVAL BOOK. SHOWS HOW,
THROUGH THE ORGANISATION OF THE BOOK AND BY THE USE OF MARGINAL SYMBOLS,
CASSIODORUS WAS ABLE TO PRESENT TO HIS STUDENTS A HANDBOOK FROM WHICH THEY
COULD LEARN THE RUDIMENTS OF THE LIBERAL ARTS THROUGH THE STUDY OF DIVINE
SCRIPTURE. THE BOOK CONSTITUTES A SELF-HELP MANUAL, WITH THE NARRATOR SPEAKING
DIRECTLY TO THE READER. CRITICAL MARKS WERE ADDED TO SPECIFIC PLACES IN THE
TEXT TO ALLOW THE READER TO STUDY WHATEVER HE WANTS IN THE TEXT, SIMPLY BY
LOCATING LIKE SYMBOLS.
