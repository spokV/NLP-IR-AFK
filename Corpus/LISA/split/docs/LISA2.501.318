INFORMATION FLOW BETWEEN PRIMARY JOURNALS AND SECONDARY SERVICES IN THE
BIOLOGICAL FIELD, PARTS I AND II.
     
AN INTERNATIONAL STUDY WAS INITIATED BY THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF EDITORS OF
BIOLOGICAL PERIODICALS (ELSE) TO DEVELOP STANDARD GUIDELINES FOR ABSTRACTS OF
DIFFERENT TYPES OF BIOLOGICAL PAPER, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF
ABSTRACTS IN PRIMARY JOURNALS AND FACILITATE THEIR USE BY SECONDARY SERVICES.
AS A PRELIMINARY STEP, A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA AND
ABSTRACT PRESENTATION AND CONTENT WAS CARRIED OUT ON A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE
OF 240 JOURNALS. DATA ARE PRESENTED ON THE COUNTRY AND LANGUAGE OF
PUBLICATION; AUTHORS' ADDRESSES; BIBLIOGRAPHIC ANNOTATIONS; CATEGORIES AND
TYPES OF PAPERS; INCLUSION OF KEYWORDS; USE OF SUB-HEADINGS; POSITION OF
ABSTRACTS; QUALITY OF ABSTRACTS; LENGTH OF PAPERS AND ABSTRACTS; PROVISION AND
QUALITY OF TRANSLATED ABSTRACTS. IN ADDITION, A SURVEY WAS MADE OF THE
INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS ISSUED BY THE 240 JOURNAL EDITORS, WITH PARTICULAR
REFERENCE TO INSTRUCTIONS ON WRITING ABSTRACTS.
