WITH BOOK ANALYSES AGAINST MORGAN KANE.
     
THE FINAL SESSION (NOV 79) OF A COMPULSORY COURSE FOR NORWEGIAN PART-TIME
LIBRARIANS DEALT WITH BOOK KNOWLEDGE, EVALUATION AND SELECTION. BASED ON
GENERAL NOVELS, IT ALSO INCLUDED HIGH QUALITY AND POPULAR LITERATURE,
INTRODUCING SYSTEMATIC BOOK ANALYSIS AND PROFESSIONAL TERMINOLOGY. ASSIGNING
NOVELS TO GENRES WITH THE AIM OF SUPPLYING ALTERNATIVES TO SUBSTANDARD
LITERATURE (SUCH AS MORGAN KANE) WAS SEEN AS BEING PARTICULARLY USEFUL. THE
ART OF SKIMMING THROUGH A BOOK AND GRASPING ITS ESSENTIALS WAS PRACTISED.
STUDY OF BOOK REVIEWS REVEALED THAT EVALUATIONS OF THE SAME BOOK CAN DIFFER
WIDELY. AIDS TO BOOK SELECTION (ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO RURAL LIBRARIANS WITH
NO LOCAL BOOKSHOP) WERE DISCUSSED. 2 EVENING SESSIONS ON POETRY WERE HELD.
STUDENTS RETURNED TO THEIR LIBRARIES WITH A NEW INTEREST IN FICTION AND GOOD
INTENTIONS OF LEADING READERS, PARTICULARLY TEENAGERS, TOWARDS BETTER-QUALITY
LITERATURE.
