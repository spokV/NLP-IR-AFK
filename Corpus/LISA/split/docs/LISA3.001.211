THE GERMAN EXPERIENCE' A CASE STUDY IN LIBRARY PROMOTION.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CONFERENCE PROMOTING AND PUBLICISING LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES, LONDON, ASLIB, 16 MAR 81. DURING RECENT YEARS THE MOST
APPARENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO WEST GERMAN LIBRARY PUBLIC RELATIONS WERE SOME
APPROACHES TOWARDS A CORPORATE VISUAL IDENTITY FOR A PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM.
COLOUR SLIDES ILLUSTRATED THE GRAPHIC CONCEPTIONS DEVELOPED FOR AND
CONSEQUENTLY APPLIED BY THE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES OF COLOGNE AND WUPPERTAL AS
WELL AS A MORE RECENT PROJECT UNDERTAKEN BY THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE AND
FINANCED BY A GOVERNMENT GRANT. INDICATES THE WIDE RANGE OF MATERIALS TO BE
CONSIDERED. STRESSES THAT ANY GRAPHIC CONTRIBUTIONS SHOULD BE SEEN IN CONTEXT
WITH OTHER SINGLE ASPECTS OF LIBRARY PUBLIC RELATIONS AND MUST ALSO BE BASED
ON AN INTEGRATED PR POLICY IN LINE WITH A LIBRARY'S GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND
THE IMAGE DESIRED.
