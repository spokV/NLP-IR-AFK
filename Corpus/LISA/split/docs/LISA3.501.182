INFLEXIBLE CONTROL SYSTEM.
     
COMPLAINS OF THE NECESSITY FOR NORWEGIAN BRANCH LIBRARIES TO MAKE SEPARATE
ANNUAL RETURNS TO SATISFY THE COUNTY LIBRARY AND THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OFFICE.
1 COORDINATED REPORT COMPILED BY THE CENTRAL LIBRARY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT.
SEPARATE RETURNS CAN BE POSITIVELY MISLEADING, SINCE, FOR INSTANCE, BOOKS
TRANSFERRED OR CIRCULATING WITHIN A LIBRARY SYSTEM CANNOT BE ACCURATELY
RECORDED. PUTS FORWARD PROPOSALS TO REDUCE THE TIME SPENT ON STATISTICS; THE
TYPE REQUIRED TO JUSTIFY THE LIBRARY'S PLACE IN SOCIETY WERE TO BE THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF A SALARIED COMMITTEE OF LIBRARIANS. BOOKSTOCK STANDARDS
WOULD ALSO BE MORE VIABLE IF FORMULATED FOR 1 AUTHORITY, WITH THE NECESSARY
DIVISIONS INTO CENTRAL LIBRARY AND BRANCHES. THE STATUS AND FUNCTION OF THE
COUNTY LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE IS QUERIED, AND THE RIGHT OF WORKERS'
ORGANISATIONS TO REPRESENTATION ON THE NATIONAL LIBRARY COUNCIL IS STRESSED.
