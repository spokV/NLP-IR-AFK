ESCRIBES THE COLLECTION AND DISCUSSES PROBLEMS OF CONSERVATION AND
DISSEMINATION AT THE FRENCH BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE DEPARTMENT OF PRINTS AND
PHOTOGRAPHY. THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE HOLDINGS ARE OUTLINED, AND
TRADITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR STORAGE AND CONSERVATION STILL IN USE SURVEYED.
SYSTEMATIC PHOTOGRAPHING AND MICROFILMING OF THE ENTIRE COLLECTION IS NOW
UNDERWAY TO ALLEVIATE BOTH CONSERVATION AND DISSEMINATION PROBLEMS. THE
ADVANTAGES OF INTRODUCING NEW TECHNIQUES SUCH AS VIDEODISCS, AND THE
FEASIBILITY OF AUTOMATION, ARE DISCUSSED. FINALLY DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF A NEW
METHOD OF PHOTOGRAPHIC REPRODUCTION RECENTLY INTRODUCED AT THE BIBLIOTHEQUE
NATIONALE, AND THE USES MADE OF IT TO DATE.
