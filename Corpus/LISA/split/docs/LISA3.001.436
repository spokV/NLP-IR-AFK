RELATIVE IMPACT OF PRINT AND DATABASE PRODUCTS ON DATABASE PRODUCER EXPENSES
AND INCOME-TRENDS FOR DATABASE PRODUCER ORGANIZATIONS BASED ON A THIRTEEN YEAR
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS.
     
A 13-YEAR ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCES OF A MAJOR DATA BASE PRODUCER ORGANISATION,
WHICH IS ALSO A PUBLISHER OF ABSTRACTING AND INDEXING PRODUCTS, INDICATES
TRENDS REGARDING THE IMPACT THAT BOTH PRINTED PRODUCTS AND DATA BASE PRODUCTS
HAVE ON THE FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE ORGANISATION. THE QUESTION OF 'MIGRATION'
(FROM PRINTED TO ON-LINE DATA BASE PRODUCTS) AND THE FACT THAT EXPENSES HAVE
INCREASED MORE THAN INCOME ARE DISCUSSED AS THEY RELATE TO THE SURVIVAL OR
GROWTH OF DATA BASE ORGANISATIONS. SINCE THE DATA BASE HAS GONE ON-LINE, THERE
HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE DATA BASE REVENUE, CONNECT HOURS, AND
NUMBERS OF ON-LINE USERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAVE BEEN DECREASES IN THE
NUMBER OF DATA BASE LEASES AND LICENCES, THE NUMBER OF PRINT PRODUCT
SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND THE EXCESS OF INCOME OVER EXPENSES. IN CONSTA NT DOLLARS,
THE COST OF PRODUCING AN ABSTRACT HAS DECREASED, THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGE FOR
PRINTED PRODUCTS HAS INCREASED ONLY SLIGHTLY, THE LEASE AND LICENSE FEES HAVE
DECREASED, ROYALTY CHARGES HAVE INCREASED, AND HOURLY CONNECT FEES HAVE
REMAINED STEADY (EVEN THOUGH THE SIZE OF THE ON-LINE FILE HAS INCREASED
GREATLY). THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF MAINTAINING A BALANCED FINANCIAL STATUS IN
LIGHT OF INCREASED INCOME FROM ONE CLASS OF PRODUCTS, DECREASED INCOME FROM
ANOTHER CLASS OF PRODUCTS, AND INCREASED COST OF OPERATION. POSSIBLE
APPROACHES TO ENSURE ECONOMIC VIABILITY ARE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF EXPENSES,
EFFICIENCY OF OPERATION, MARKETING, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND PRICING. THE MOST
PROMISING APPROACHES LIE IN THE AREAS OF PRICING AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW
PRODUCTS AND SERVI CES. THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A CONSORTIUM OF DATA
BASE PRODUCERS FOR OFFERING ON-LINE SERVICES IS PROPOSED. THERE APPEARS TO BE
NO ALTERNATIVE TO INCREASING THE PRICES FOR ON-LINE USERS.
