AN ALGORITHM FOR SUFFIX STRIPPING.
     
THE AUTOMATIC REMOVAL OF SUFFIXES IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE FIELD OF
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. AN ALGORITHM FOR SUFFIX STRIPPING IS DESCRIBED, WHICH
HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AS A SHORT, FAST PROGRAM IN BCPL. IT EFFECTIVELY WORKS BY
TREATING COMPLEX SUFFIXES AS COMPOUNDS MADE UP OF SIMPLE SUFFIXES, AND
REMOVING THE SIMPLE SUFFIXES IN A NUMBER OF STEPS. IN EACH STEP THE REMOVAL OF
THE SUFFIX IS MADE TO DEPEND UPON THE FORM OF THE REMAINING STEM, WHICH
USUALLY INVOLVES A MEASURE OF ITS SYLLABLE LENGTH.
