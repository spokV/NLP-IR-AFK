AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEMS VIS-A-VIS AUTOMATED CATALOGUING.

AN AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE DEVELOPED WITHOUT DUE REGARD TO
AN EXISTING AUTOMATED CATALOGUING SYSTEM. ABOVE ALL, THERE SHOULD BE THE
FACILITY FOR DATA EXCHANGE, TO PRODUCE MACHINE-READABLE BOOK LABELS, AND TO
ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY FILES WITHOUT DUPLICATION OF DATA. THERE ARE PROBLEMS,
HOWEVER, AS CATALOGUE AND LENDING ARE BASED UPON TITLE-ENTRY AND BOOK AS
PHYSICAL UNIT RESPECTIVELY, AND FURTHER, THE COMPLEX STRUCTURE OF TITLE-ENTRY
AND CALL NUMBER. VARIOUS FUNCTIONS OF THE SYSTEM MAKE IT NECESSARY TO CONNECT
DIFFERENT BOOK UNITS ACCORDING TO TITLE ENTRY. A SHORT TITLE IS NECESSARY FOR
OVERDUE NOTICES. DISCUSSES PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM CATALOGUING WITH AN
OFF-LINE SYSTEM, WHILST USING AN ON-LINE CIRCULATION SYSTEM.
