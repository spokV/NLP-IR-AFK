PRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE PRESENT SITUATION RELATING TO
LIBRARIES AND THE FRENCH SPEAKING VISUALLY HANDICAPPED IN CANADA AND MAKES
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT. STATISTICS SHOW THE EXTENT OF VISUAL HANDICAP
IN QUEBEC, THE EXISTING SUBSTITUTES FOR CONVENTIONAL READING MATERIALS ARE
BRIEFLY DESCRIBED, AND SERVICES IN THE U.K. AND U.S.A. ARE OUTLINED AS MODELS.
DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE SPECIALISED MATERIALS AVAILABLE IN QUEBEC FROM THE
CANADIAN NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR THE BLIND; THE NAZARETH AND LOUIS BRAILLE
INSTITUTE; AND THE QUEBEC TAPE LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND. THE READER SERVICES
OFFERED BY THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE CRITICISED AS INADEQUATE, AND THE RESULTS OF
A PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF 60 USERS CONDUCTED IN MARCH 81 ARE PRESENTED AS
EVIDENCE OF THE EXTENT OF READERS' INTERESTS AND THEIR IGNORANCE OF THE
SERVICES AVAILABLE. PROPOSES ORGANISATION OF USER TRAINING PROGRAMMES,
ASSESSES THE ADVANTAGES AND INCONVENIENCES  OF ORDINARY LIBRARY SERVICES, AND
SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN GENERAL.
