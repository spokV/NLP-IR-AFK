SERVICE TO OLDER ADULT USERS OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES' A STUDY OF LIBRARIAN
ATTITUDES.
     
(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH.) A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SENT TO 311
LIBRARIANS AT US COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES SPONSORING ELDERHOSTEL (A PROGRAMME
FOR ADULTS AGED OVER 60, OFFERED ON MANY CAMPUSES) FOR AT LEAST 2 YEARS DURING
1977-79. THE 197 REPLIES CONTAINING USABLE DATA INDICATED THAT THE LIBRARIANS
DISAGREED WITH STEREOTYPIC STATEMENTS CONCERNING OLDER ADULTS; CONTACT WITH
OLDER ADULT RELATIVES WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE LIBRARIANS'
RESPONSES TO THE STATEMENTS; IMPLEMENTING LIBRARY PROGRAMMES FOR OLDER ADULTS
WAS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN LIBRARIANS' AGREEMENT WITH SUGGESTED LIBRARY
SERVICES FOR OLDER ADULTS, WHILE PLANNING PROGRAMMES FOR THEM WAS LESS
SIGNIFICANT AND VOLUNTEER COMMUNITY WORK WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR; AND
LIBRARIANS FELT THAT AGE IS NOT NECESSARILY A DEBILITATIVE FACTOR WITH REGARD
TO LEARNING AND MOTIVATION TO LEARN.
