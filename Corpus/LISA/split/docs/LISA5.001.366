A WONDERFUL TOY.

THE DANISH TECHNICAL LIBRARY AT THE DANISH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY SET UP A DATA
BASE IN 1968 CONTAINING LOCATIONS OF THE LIBRARY'S OWN HOLDINGS. AT THE END OF
THE 70S THIS FACILITY WAS EXPANDED TO AN ON-LINE SYSTEM OF LOCATING ALSO OTHER
LIBRARIES' ACQUISITIONS AND CONNECTED TO SCANNET AND EURONET. DESCRIBES A NEW
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM, CALLED ALIS (AUTOMATED LIBRARY INFORMATION SYSTEM),
INITIATED IN NOV 81. IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO REQUISITION TITLES THROUGH THE ALIS
CATALOGUES. THESE TITLES WILL BE THOSE READILY AVAILABLE, AS THE LIBRARY'S
LOANS WILL BE REGISTERED IN THE TERMINAL FROM 1982. USE OF ALIS IS FREE. THE
SYSTEM, DESCRIBED DIAGRAMMATICALLY, CONSISTS OF A LOCAL SYSTEM FOR
ADMINISTRATION OF LOANS, AND THE I/S DATACENTRALEN'S FREE TEXT STANDARD SEARCH
SYSTEM.
