USE OF THE DANISH VETERINARY AND AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY BY DIRECT LIBRARY USERS
AND USERS OF AN ONLINE DOCUMENTATION SERVICE.
     
AS A RESULT OF A REDUCTION IN THE ACQUISITION BUDGET THE DANISH VETERINARY AND
AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY CARRIED OUT AN ANALYSIS OF THE PRESENT USE OF THE
LIBRARY. THIS WAS DONE TO DETERMINE WHICH PARTS OF THE COLLECTION COULD BE CUT
DOWN WITHOUT CAUSING TOO MUCH INCONVENIENCE TO THE SUERS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT
APPPROXIMATELY 85% OF REQUESTS FOR JOURNALS WERE COVERED BY APPROXIMATELY 7%
OF THE CURRENT SERIALS. APPROXIMATELY 30% OF REQUESTS WERE FOR BOOKS. IT WAS
CONCLUDED THAT AN EFFICIENT BACK-UP SERVICE FOR AN ON-LINE DOCUMENTATION
SERVICE COULD BE PROVIDED BY THE LIBRARY COLLECTION, THE DANISH INTERLENDING
LIBRARY STRUCTURE AND SCANDINAVIAN CO-OPERATION AGREEMENTS. THIS BACK-UP
SERVICE IS PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE IN EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS. IT WAS DECIDED THAT
A JOINT SCANDINAVIAN UNION CATALOGUE OF FOREIGN SERIALS BASED ON THE ISDS FILE
WILL BE A VALUABLE TOOL IN THE SCAN DINAVIAN INTERLENDING SYSTEMS.
