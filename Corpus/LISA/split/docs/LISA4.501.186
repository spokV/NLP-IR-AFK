GERMAN LIBRARIES' THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.
     
LECTURE GIVEN TO A MEETING OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT IN BERLIN. GERMANS ARE
PROUD OF THEIR RIGHT TO THE FREE EXPRESSION OF OPINION IN SPEECH AND IN
WRITING, YET THIS VERY FREEDOM CAN CAUSE CONFUSION. SINCE INFORMATION CAN BE
UNSCRUPULOUSLY MANIPULATED A RESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE MUST BE MAINTAINED.
INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION FOR STOCK PURCHASE AND LOANS IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEP
COSTS DOWN. LIBRARIES OFTEN RANK LOW IN LISTS OF CULTURAL PRIORITIES OWING TO
A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS AND A LACK OF PUBLIC INTEREST;
MARKET ECONOMY CRITERIA CANNOT BE APPLIED TO THEM. THE PROVISION OF
INFORMATION AND LITERATURE MUST BE PLANNED RATIONALLY. MANY LIBRARIES HAVE HAD
TO ACCEPT CUTS IN THEIR BUDGETS ALTHOUGH THE PRICES OF BOOKS AND PERIODICALS
HAVE RISEN; COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND THE BOOK TRADE MUST BE IMPROVED.
