THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS PROVIDER OF VIDEO.
     
DESCRIBES THE AVAILABILITY OF VIDEOTAPES AND EQUIPMENT IN DANISH PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. THIS AMOUNTED IN 1977 TO 5 LIBRARIES. MOST OF THE PROGRAMMES ARE
LOCALLY PRODUCED BY AMATEUR GROUPS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND LOCAL HISTORICAL
PURPOSES. ONLY 1 LIBRARY HAS TAKEN UP THE OFFER OF DEPOSIT OF VIDEO CASSETTES
FROM THE STATE FILM CENTRE. REFERS TO VARIOUS REPORTS WHICH MAKE IT CLEAR THAT
VIDEO IS A MATERIAL WHICH PROPERLY BELONGS IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY AND CAN BE
ACQUIRED WITH PUBLIC MONEY. THE DESIRABILITY OF HAVING RADIO AND TV PROGRAMMES
AVAILABLE FOR LOAN IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS OFTEN BEEN POINTED OUT, BUT THIS
WOULD NECESSITATE CHANGES IN THE COPYRIGHT ACT OR DIRECT NEGOTIATION BY THE
LIBRARIES WITH THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS. ARCHIVES FOR RADIO AND TV PRODUCTIONS
SHOULD BE SET UP AND THE LAW ON LEGAL DEPOSITS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE NON-BOOK
MATERIAL. COOPERATION WITHIN THE NORDIC COUNCIL IS URGED, AND EXPERIMENTS IN
SELECTED LIBRARIES ARE RECOMMENDED.
