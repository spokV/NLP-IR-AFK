LIP SERVICE' THE UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARY INSTRUCTION PROGRAM AT THE OHIO STATE
UNIVERSITY.
     
IN THE 1ST PHASE OF A COMPREHENSIVE LIBRARY USER EDUCATION PROGRAMME AT OHIO
STATE UNIVERSITY, ALL INCOMING STUDENTS ARE ORIENTED TO THE USE OF 1 OR 2
UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARIES, LISTEN TO A LECTURE ON THE USE OF BASIC LIBRARY
TOOLS, AND THEN ARE EXPECTED TO COMPLETE AN EXERCISE IN FINDING INFORMATION ON
THEIR OWN WITHIN THE LIBRARY. THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN
THAT A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMME, WHICH REACHES 8,600 STUDENTS IN A TYPICAL FALL
TERM, IS POSSIBLE USING EXISTING STAFF.
