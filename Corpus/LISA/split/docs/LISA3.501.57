COURSES FOR SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP OFFERED IN A.L.A. ACCREDITED PROGRAMS AND
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EDUCATION OF SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIANS.
     
A SURVEY WAS MADE OF THE 68 LIBRARY SCHOOLS WITH A.L.A. ACCREDITATION TO
ASCERTAIN THE EXTENT AND TYPES OF THEIR COURSES IN SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP, IN
SPECIFIC TYPES OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES, AND IN SPECIFIC TYPES OF LITERATURE. FROM
THE SURVEY RESULTS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MAKE AN ANALYSIS OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH
THESE COURSES WOULD SERVE THE NEEDS OF THOSE INTERESTED IN SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY
LIBRARIES. THE ROLE OF FIELD WORK WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED. STATISTICS ARE
PRESENTED ON THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF COURSES OFFERED AND THE TYPE OF FIELD
WORK AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS CONCERNED WITH SCI-TECH LIBRARIANSHIP.
