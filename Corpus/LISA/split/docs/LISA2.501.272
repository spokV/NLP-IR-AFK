THE IMPORTANCE OF COOPERATION FOR THE UTILISATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL LITERATURE.
     
HUNGARIAN NON-INDUSTRIAL PHARMACEUTICAL INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT PROVIDED WITH
SPECIAL LITERATURE. THEIR LIBRARIES AND BOOK COLLECTIONS BELONG TO THE MEDICAL
LIBRARY NETWORK, BUT THEY ARE THE 'STEPCHILDREN' OF THE NETWORK, AND DO NOT
UTILISE ADVANTAGES TO BE EXPECTED FROM COOPERATION. CONDITIONS IN BUDAPEST ARE
MORE FAVOURABLE THAN ELSEWHERE IN HUNGARY, AS PHARMACISTS CAN VISIT THE
NETWORK CENTRES, THE HUNGARIAN TECHNICAL LIBRARY AND THE LIBRARY OF THE
HUNGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. ELSEWHERE, PHARMACISTS CAN ONLY RELY ON A SMALL
AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE LITERATURE. RECOMMENDS IMPROVEMENTS IN ACQUISITIONS, AND
INTERLIBRARY LOANS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY COOPERATION, AND
DISCUSSES A DATA BANK ESTABLISHED BY THE HUNGARIAN NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF
PHARMACEUTICS, WHICH HOLDS INFORMATION ON FOREIGN DRUG COMPOUNDS, THEIR
PRODUCERS, INDICATIONS AND COUNTERINDICATIONS, SIDE-EFFECTS, AND POSSIBLE
HUNGARIAN EQUIVALENTS.
