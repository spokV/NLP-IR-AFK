AN EXPERIMENT IN CLASSIFICATION: BASED ON WILLIAM GOFFMAN'S 'INDIRECT METHOD'
OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
     
BASED ON A PAPER PREPARED FOR A CLASSIFICATION THEORY COURSE AT CASE WESTERN
RESERVE UNIVERSITY, OHIO, A REVISED VERSION OF WHICH WAS PRESENTED AT A
CANADIAN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH GROUP CONFERENCE, LONDON, ONTARIO, MAY 78.
DESCRIBES AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS OF DOCUMENT
CLASSES RETRIEVED USING GOFFMAN'S INDIRECT METHOD; HOW THESE CLASSES ARE
SIMILAR TO, OR DIFFERENT FROM, THE CLASSES OBTAINED WHEN A FACETED
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM IS APPLIED TO THE SAME SET OF DOCUMENTS; AND THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CLUSTERS OF TERMS WHICH INTER-RELATE A DEFINABLE CLASS
OF DOCUMENTS. A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 101 ENTRIES IN THE SUBJECT INDEXING SECTION
OF 2LISA1, 1976, WERE USED. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE INDIRECT METHOD
COULD HAVE SOME MERIT IN SEARCH STRATEGIES IN COMPUTERISED INFORMATION STORAGE
AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS BASED ON KEYWORDS OR A CONTROLLED VOCABULARY.
