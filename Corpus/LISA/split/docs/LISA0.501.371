PATENT INFORMATION SYSTEM' A PROCEDURE ADOPTED BY IIP.

DESCRIBES THE USE OF COORDINATE INDEXING AT THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF PETROLEUM
(IIP) TO RETRIEVE INDIAN PATENTS ON SPECIFIC SUBJECTS, THE PATENT NUMBERS
BEING UNKNOWN. THE INSTITUTE INDEXES THE PATENTS USING THE API (AMERICAN
PETROLEUM INSTITUTE) THESAURUS, THE IIP THESAURUS, AND THE INDIAN PATENT
OFFICE CLASSIFICATION NUMBER. THE RESULTANT IN-DEPTH COVERAGE OF THE PATENTS
BRIDGES THE INTER-DISCIPLINE GAP MORE SATISFACTORILY THAN CLASSIFICATION
ALONE.
