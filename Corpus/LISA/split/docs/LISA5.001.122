THE INNOVATION MOVEMENT IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES 1981-85.

UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE EAST GERMAN MINISTRY OF CULTURE, DAS ZENTRALINSTITUT
FUR BIBLIOTHEKSWESEN (CENTRAL INSTITUTE FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE) IS ORGANISING A
PROGRAMME ENCOURAGING LIBRARY STAFF TO DEVISE NEW TECHNICAL AIDS, WORK
PROCESSES AND ECONOMIC MEASURES. EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT SUCH INNOVATIONS
CAN BE APPLIED ON A SCALE MUCH WIDER THAN THAT OF THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT,
DETERMINING FACTORS BEING THE CONDITIONS, STRUCTURE AND TECHNICAL LEVEL OF
EACH LIBRARY. THE INNOVATION DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A NEW INVENTION BUT SHOULD
RATHER BE A BETTER USE OF EXISTING MATERIAL OR IDEAS. THOSE TESTING THE
INNOVATIONS MUST HAVE A GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SUBJECT. MORE PARTICIPATION
MUST BE ENCOURAGED FROM THE YOUNG STAFF MEMBERS.
