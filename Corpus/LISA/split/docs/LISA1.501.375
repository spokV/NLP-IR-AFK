SUBJECT CATALOGUING IN LARGE UNIVERSAL LIBRARIES.
     
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS OF SUBJECT CATALOGUING (CLASSIFICATION) IN LARGE GENERAL
LIBRARIES, PARTICULARLY IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, WESTERN EUROPE AND NORTH
AMERICA' NATIONAL, UNIVERSITY, LARGE PUBLIC AND ACADEMY OF SCIENCES LIBRARIES
WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. DISCUSSES SUBJECT HEADINGS AND USE OF THE MAIN
CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES, INCLUDING DEWEY, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND COLON.
CLASSIFICATION METHODS EMPLOYED IN NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY PRODUCTION ARE ALSO
DESCRIBED. THE LARGEST GROUP OF LIBRARIES USES ITS OWN SYSTEMS, THEN
SUCCESSIVELY DDC, LCC, UDC AND BBK. THE SITUATION IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE MUCH
IN THE FUTURE, BUT THE NUMBER OF LIBRARIES USING THEIR OWN SCHEMES WILL
DIMINISH, WHILE THE CLASSED CATALOGUE TOGETHER WITH THE ALPHABETICAL SUBJECT
CATALOGUE WILL PROBABLY BECOME MORE COMMON.
