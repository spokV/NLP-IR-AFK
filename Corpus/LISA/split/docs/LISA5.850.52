DOBIS-WLN IMPACT STUDY. REPORT.

THE BCUC STUDY TEAM EXAMINED 3 SYSTEMS FOR POSSIBLE APPLICATION TO THE BRITISH
COLUMBIA UNION CATALOGUE' WASHINGTON LIBRARY NETWORK, DOBIS AS IMPLEMENTED BY
COLLEGE BIBLIOCENTRE AND DOBIS AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF
CANADA. IT WAS FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SYSTEMS WOULD BE USABLE BY BCUC WITHOUT
SOME MODIFICATION. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY VERSION OF DOBIS WAS SELECTED WITH THE
QUALIFICATION THAT MORE INITIAL WORK WOULD BE NEEDED THAN THE OTHERS TO BRING
IT INTO PRODUCTION.
