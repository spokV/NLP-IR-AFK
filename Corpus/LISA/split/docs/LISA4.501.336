TWO YEARS OF DEALING WITH SWEDISH PUBLICATIONS.
     
DESCRIBES HOW LINKOPING UNIVERSITY LIBRARY COPES WITH THE DEPOSIT COPIES OF
200,000 SWEDISH PUBLICATIONS PER YEAR WHICH IT HAS BEEN RECEIVING SINCE IT
BECAME A DEPOSIT LIBRARY ON 1 JAN 79. BY USING THE LIST OF SWEDISH PERIODICALS
SOME PRIOR CATALOGUING COULD BE DONE. A PLAN FOR DISTRIBUTION OF THE MATERIAL
ACCORDING TO SUBJECT TO THE 7 UNITS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
WAS DRAWN UP. AFTER 2 YEARS SOME PUBLISHERS ARE STILL NOT AWARE OF THEIR DUTY
TO DELIVER, AND ROUTINES FOR CLAIMING HAVE HAD TO BE DEVELOPED. THE MONOGRAPH
COPIES RECEIVED ARE INTENDED AS REGIONAL COPIES FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OTHER
INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE REGION, OR COPIES FOR USE WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY; A
POLICY OF WITHDRAWAL WAS DEVELOPED, AS NO ARCHIVAL DUTY EXISTS. PROBLEMS WERE
CAUSED BY THE NUMBER AND LATE DELIVERY OF PERIODICALS. HANDLING OF LEAFLETS
AND OTHER EPHEMERA HAS PROVED MOST COMPLICATED AND TIME CONSUMING, AND THIS
MATERIAL REMAINS UNCATALOGUED. THE QUESTION OF ITS FUTURE NEEDS URGENTLY TO BE
DECIDED.
