CATALOGUING IN THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY' DEVELOPMENT AND TENDENCIES.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE GERMAN LIBRARIANS CONFERENCE AT
REGENSBURG, 9-13 JUNE 81. FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING, REGENSBURG UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY USES THE RAK RULES FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIES; FURTHER STREAMLINING WILL
BE CARRIED OUT HERE BECAUSE THE BAVARIAN STATE LIBRARY WILL SHORTLY JOIN THE
BAVARIAN NEW UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' INTERLOAN SYSTEM. KEYWORD USE IS
STANDARDISED; A KEYWORD INDEX PUBLISHED EVERY 6 MONTHS ASSISTS IN UNIFYING
PRACTICE. ENGLISH KEYWORDS ARE USED FOR BIOLOGY AND PRE-CLINICAL MEDICINE,
GERMAN FOR OTHER SUBJECTS. REGENSBURG UNIVERSITY'S OWN CLASSIFICATION SCHEME
IS USED HERE AND IN OTHER LIBRARIES IN THE INTERLOAN SCHEME. SINCE 1974
PRINTED CATALOGUE VOLUMES HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY COM-PROCESS MICROFICHE, WHICH
MAY IN TURN BE REPLACED BY ON-LINE METHODS WHEN THESE HAVE BECOME CHEAPER.
ACCESS TO OTHER REGIONAL LIBRARY NETWORKS MAY SOON BE AVAILABLE THROUGH
ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING.
