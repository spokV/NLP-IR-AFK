HERE THE LIBRARIAN DONATES HER SALARY TO THE LIBRARY.
     
A TALK GIVEN TO THE 14TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING ON THE THEME' PART-TIME
LIBRARIES TODAY AND TOMORROW. WITH A DEFINITION OF PART-TIME LIBRARIES AS
THOSE OPEN ONLY A FEW HOURS A WEEK, ICELAND HAS ONLY 15 FULL-TIME LIBRARIES
OUT OF 250; 25 OF 40 CENTRAL LIBRARIES ARE PART-TIME. WITH 60% OF THE
POPULATION LIVING IN THE REYKJAVIK REGION AND THE REST SCATTERED IN SMALL
LOCAL AUTHORITIES, IT IS NOT ECONOMICALLY POSSIBLE TO HAVE A LIBRARY SERVICE
WHICH FULFILS IFLA NORMS. THE LIBRARY ACT OF 1976 MADE LOCAL AUTHORITIES
FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR LIBRARIES. MANY, THEREFORE, COMBINED SCHOOL AND
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, AS EDUCATION RECEIVES STATE SUPPORT. MOST LIBRARIES CHARGE
FEES FOR BORROWING AND MOST LIBRARIANS ARE UNQUALIFIED. THE SOLUTION LIES IN
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CENTRAL LIBRARIES TO 8; THESE SHOULD BE RUN BY THE
STATE AND HAVE MOBILE LIBRARIES. LOCAL LIBRARIES SHOULD ALSO BE FEWER.
TRAINING FOR PART-TIME LIBRARIANS WITH PROPER SALARY CONDI TIONS SHOULD BE
INITIATED.
