OPTIMAL OPENING HOURS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
DESPITE RECENT INCREASES IN STOCKS AND READERSHIP, PUBLIC LIBRARIES MUST
ATTAIN EVEN HIGHER STANDARDS OF ACHIEVEMENT. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE USED BY ONLY
A SMALL PROPORTION OF INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL WORKERS, APPRENTICES AND
SCHOOLCHILDREN; ONE WAY TO ENCOURAGE MORE OF THEM TO USE LIBRARIES COULD BE TO
MAKE OPENING HOURS LONGER AND MORE CONVENIENT FOR THEM, ESPECIALLY IN THE
EVENING. LIBRARIES COULD RESERVE THE MORNINGS AND EARLY AFTERNOONS FOR
ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROCESSING WORK AND THEN OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AT LEAST TILL 6
P.M., DEPENDING ON LOCAL CONDITIONS. ALL DEPARTMENTS FOR PUBLIC USE SHOULD BE
OPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY AND STAFF TRAINING MUST BE DEVELOPED SO THAT EXPERT
ASSISTANCE IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC.
