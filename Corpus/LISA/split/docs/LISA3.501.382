UDC AND HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES.
     
THE FOLLOWING PAPERS WERE GIVEN IN A UDC CONFERENCE IN JYVASKYLA IN SPRING 81:
GENERAL OVERVIEW OF PRESENT UDC; UDC AND AUTOMATED INFORMATION HANDLING; CHAIN
INDEXING; CATALOGUING FINNISH LITERATURE; AND CENTRALISED CATALOGUING. ONE OF
THE MAJOR PROBLEMS OF UDC IS ITS SLOW MACHINERY FOR REVISION. THE STRUCTURE OF
THE SCHEME IS WELL SUITED FOR AUTOMATIC APPLICATION. UDC IS USED FOR THE
CLASSIFICATION OF LEGAL DEPOSIT MATERIALS IN FINLAND. THE PRESENT FINNISH
EDITION OF THE SCHEME NEEDS URGENT REVISION, PARTICULARLY IN THE HUMANITIES
SUBJECTS.
