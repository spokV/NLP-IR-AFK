AN APPROACH TOWARD FUNCTIONAL TEXT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS.
     
A STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF TEXTS IS PRESENTED AS A PART OF A SEMANTIC METHOD FOR
REPRESENTING SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS. 4 CONCEPTS OF THEME, METHOD,
RESULT AND DISCUSSION ARE SELECTED AND A MODEL SET OF 'FUNCTIONAL PATTERNS'
CONSISTING OF META-TERMS IN EACH SENTENCE OF THE ABSTRACT IS PREPARED. A
PRELIMINARY COMPUTER EXPERIMENT PRODUCED A PATTERN MATCHING PROCEDURE
IDENTIFYING THE INFORMATION FUNCTION FOR EACH SENTENCE OF THE ABSTRACT BASED
ON THE MODEL SET. THE RESULTS ARE EXAMINED AND DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF
REPRODUCIBILITY OF THE MODEL SET AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROCEDURE FOR THE
OTHER DATA SETS.
