TELECONFERENCE IN VIRTUAL SPACE.
     
THE AUTHOR'S INVENTION OF VIRTUAL SPACE IS THE BASIS OF A RESEARCH PROGRAMME
TO STUDY THE USE IN TELECONFERENCING OF THE SAME MODES OF COMMUNICATION WHICH
WORK WELL IN FACE-TO-FACE COMMUNICATION. IT CAN BE USED TO CREATE AT EACH SITE
OF A TELECONFERENCE THE ESSENTIAL SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT WOULD OCCUR IF
ALL THE PARTICIPANTS WERE AT EACH SITE. EACH PARTICIPANT IS SURROUNDED BY A
GROUP OF SURROGATE UNITS, ONE UNIT PER OTHER PARTICIPANT AND EACH UNIT
COMPRISING CAMERA, MICROPHONE, VISUAL DISPLAY, AND SPEAKER. THE RELATIVE
POSITIONS OF THE PARTICIPANTS ARE THE SAME AT EACH SITE.
