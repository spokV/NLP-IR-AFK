THE ORGANISATIONAL AND FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE OF AN UNIFIED COLLECTION OF
LITERATURE ON NATURAL SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY.

PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF AN ANALYSIS OF THE ORGANISATION AND OF THE STRUCTURE
OF THE UNIFIED INFORMATION STOCK (LITERATURE ON NATURAL SCIENCES AND
TECHNOLOGY) OF THE ARMENIAN SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLIC. THE ANALYSIS
CONCENTRATES ON 3 MAIN AREAS: ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANISATION OF THE STOCK;
SUBJECT COVERAGE; AND TERRITORIAL DISTRIBUTION. CHEMICAL LITERATURE REPRESENTS
THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF THE STOCK. MOST OF THE INFORMATION STOCK IS LOCATED
IN THE EREVAN REGION (88.4%), WHILE ONLY 0.3% OF THE STOCK IS LOCATED IN THE
KAFAN REGION, DUE TO THE DIFFERENT LEVEL OF INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE
REGIONS.
