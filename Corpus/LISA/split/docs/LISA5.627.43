THE MANAGEMENT AND SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE' AN INTERDISCIPLINARY
CROSS-CITATION ANALYSIS.

A METHOD IS PROPOSED FOR MEASURING INTERDISCIPLINARY RELATIONS IN SCIENTIFIC
LITERATURE BASED ON CROSS CITATION AMONG CORE JOURNALS EMPIRICALLY SELECTED ON
THE BASIS OF USE AND IMPORTANCE. THE METHOD IS USED TO TEST HYPOTHESES DERIVED
FROM A BIBLIOMETRIC DEFINITION OF INTERDISCIPLINARITY AMONG THE MANAGEMENT AND
SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURES. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE MANAGEMENT LITERATURE
IS DEPENDENT ON THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, THAT IS MORE DEPENDENT ON THEM THAN VICE
VERSA, AND THAT IT IS MORE DEPENDENT ON THEM THAN THEY ARE ON EACH OTHER.
