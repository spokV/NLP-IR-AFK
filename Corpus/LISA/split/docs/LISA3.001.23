REFLECTIONS OF A BLACK LIBRARIAN.
     
THE AUTHOR WAS RECRUITED INTO THE US LIBRARY PROFESSION IN THE 1950S BECAUSE
OF AN EXPRESSED NEED FOR MORE BLACK MALE LIBRARIANS. HE DECIDED TO WORK IN
BLACK ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE HE FELT HIS EXPERTISE WAS NEEDED THERE.
THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING SUCH ESTABLISHMENTS COMPELLED HIM TO GIVE
QUALITY LIBRARY SERVICE WITH LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES. CLAIMS THAT BECAUSE
OF THIS BLACK LIBRARIANS HAVE TO BE TWICE AS GOOD. DISCUSSES THE UNIQUE ROLE
OF BLACK LIBRARIANS IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND THE HURDLES THEY MUST
CONQUER.
