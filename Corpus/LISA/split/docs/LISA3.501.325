PUBLIC LIBRARY BOOKSTOCKS: NEW STANDARDS OR NO STANDARDS?.
     
CONSIDERS THE VARIABLE FACTORS AFFECTING STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES, AND
DISCUSSES THE ATTEMPTS MADE BY THE BOURDILLON REPORT IN 1962, AND THE LATEST
IFLA STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES, TO FORMULATE STANDARDS FOR BOOKSTOCK.
ARGUES THAT, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A GOOD STANDARD OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE IN
THE UK, THERE SHOULD BE A NEW AND HIGH LEVEL ENQUIRY INTO HOW MUCH OF THE
GREATLY INCREASED OUTPUT OF BRITISH PUBLISHING SHOULD BE PURCHASED TODAY.
POINTS OUT THAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE KNOWN IS WHETHER PUBLIC LIBRARY BOOKFUNDS ARE
NOW CUT TO THE POINT WHERE THE QUANTITY OF NEW BOOKS BEING ADDED IS NOT
MATCHING THOSE WITHDRAWN THROUGH WEAR AND TEAR, AND THAT IDEALLY THERE SHOULD
BE AN EXCESS OF ADDITIONS.
