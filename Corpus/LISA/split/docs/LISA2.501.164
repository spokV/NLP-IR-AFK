REQUIREMENTS AND SUPPLY OF LITERATURE IN PHARMACEUTICAL TRAINING.
     
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAW A LINE BETWEEN THE TRAINING OF PHARMACISTS AND OTHER
NATURAL SCIENCE TRAINING. IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHAT THE PURPOSE OF TRAINING
ACTUALLY IS, BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT PHARMACISTS MUST BE TRAINED TO PRACTISE
IMMEDIATELY IN A PHARMACY, AT A SICK-BED, IN A RESEARCH INSTITUTE OR A
PHARMACEUTICAL FACTORY. THOSE INVOLVED IN TRAINING NEED SPECIALIST BOOKS AND
JOURNALS. IN HUNGARY, THESE CAN BE PURCHASED BY EVERYBODY, ALTHOUGH PURCHASE
OF FOREIGN MATERIALS MAY BE FINANCIALLY DIFFICULT. LIBRARY BUDGETS SHOULD
PERMIT THE PURCHASE OF EXPENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND ABSTRACTING JOURNALS, AND
REFERENCE BOOKS, LIBRARIANS INSISTING ON THEIR CONTINUOUS ACQUISITION.
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS MAY BE SOLVED BY BUDGETS WHICH FOLLOW PROPORTIONAL PRICE
INCREASE, AND BY GOVERNMENTS WILLING TO REDUCE IMPORT PROFIT RATES OF
MATERIALS FOR EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND MEDICAL TREATMENT. LIBRARIANS SHOULD BE
WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE TERMINOLOGY, TRAINING SYSTEM AND LITERATURE OF THEIR
FIELD, AND BE QUALIFIED TO INTRODUCE READERS TO INTELLECTUAL WORK.
