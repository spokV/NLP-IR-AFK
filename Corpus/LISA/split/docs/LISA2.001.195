PROBLEMS OF MERGING LIBRARIES.
     
IN FEB 80, IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE TASMANIAN COLLEGE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION
(CAE) AT MT NELSON (HOBART) WOULD CLOSE AND THAT THE MAJORITY OF ITS COURSES
WOULD TRANSFER TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TASMANIA. THE UNIVERSITY WOULD BECOME
AUSTRALIA'S 1ST 'COMPREHENSIVE UNIVERSITY', PROVIDING CAE-STYLE COURSES AS
WELL AS ITS TRADITIONAL ONES. ON 1 JAN 81, THE UNIVERSITY TOOK OVER THE
COLLEGE'S DEPARTMENTS OF TEACHER EDUCATION, ART, MUSIC, AND LIBRARIANSHIP.
DESCRIBES THE IMPACT ON THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY; HOW THE 90,000-ITEM MT NELSON
LIBRARY WAS EVALUATED AND MERGED WITH THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY; AND HOW THE
RESULTANT COLLECTION IS BEING 'TIDIED UP'.
