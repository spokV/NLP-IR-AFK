INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL COOPERATION IN SOCIAL SCIENCE DOCUMENTATION.
     
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN SOCIAL SCIENCE DOCUMENTATION (COVERING IN THE
WIDEST SENSE ALL ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE COLLECTION, PROCESSING AND
TRANSFER OF INFORMATION) IS ESSENTIAL, YET THE VERY NATURE OF THE INFORMATION
CREATES OBSTACLES TO COOPERATION. MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF ESTABLISHING
COOPERATION HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTED AND CONSTANT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AT ALL
LEVELS. ONE OF THE 1ST TASKS FACING THESE CONTEMPLATING COOPERATION IS TO
IMPROVE RECIPROCAL INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE SUBJECTS FOR COOPERATION AND ON THE
MEANS AT THEIR DISPOSAL. THEY SHOULD THEN EXCHANGE MATERIALS, INFORMATION,
IDEAS, AND PROJECTS. IF FURTHER COOPERATION IS PROPOSED, JOINT OBJECTIVES
COULD BE ACHIEVED, NETWORKS ESTABLISHED, AND MOVES TOWARDS INTERNATIONAL
STANDARDISATION INITIATED.
