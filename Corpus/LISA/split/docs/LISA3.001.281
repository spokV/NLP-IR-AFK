ASPECTS OF USER EDUCATION IN UK ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, 1976-1981.
     
ACTIVITIES IN UK ACADEMIC LIBRARY USER EDUCATION IN THE PREVIOUS 5 YEARS ARE
REVIEWED, WITH AN ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AND THEIR
IMPLICATIONS. DEVELOPMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN LIBRARY ORIENTATION, LIBRARY
GUIDING AND SIGN-POSTING AND PRINTED LIBRARY GUIDES ARE CONSIDERED, AND
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ARE NOTED. EVALUATION OF USER EDUCATION PROGRAMMES IS SEEN
AS THE MAJOR PROBLEM FACING ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, AND SOME EXAMPLES OF ATTEMPTS
AT EVALUATION, INCLUDING THE TRAVELLING WORKSHOPS EXPERIMENT, ARE GIVEN. A
BRIEF LOOK IS TAKEN AT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND SOME AREAS, SUCH AS STUDY
SKILLS, ARE IDENTIFIED AS BEING THOSE WHICH SHOULD NOW BE UNDER CONSIDERATION.
