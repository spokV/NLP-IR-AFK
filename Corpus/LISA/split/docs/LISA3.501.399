PIGGY IN THE MIDDLE: OBSERVATIONS ON THE ROLE OF THE INTERMEDIARY.
     
IT WAS CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED BY SYSTEM DESIGNERS THAT ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
SEARCH SYSTEMS, WITH THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO
INFORMATION, WOULD BE INTERROGATED BY THE END USER. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
REVEALS HOWEVER, THAT CONTRARY TO SUCH EXPECTATIONS, MOST SEARCHES ARE STILL
BEING PERFORMED BY TRAINED INTERMEDIARIES. CLEARLY, THE ATTEMPT TO CONVERT
FORMER OFF-LINE BATCH SYSTEMS USED BY EITHER COMPUTER SCIENTISTS OR
INFORMATION SPECIALISTS, INTO ON-LINE INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS FOR USE BY ALL HAS
NOT WORKED, DESPITE THE CLAIMS OF THEIR DESIGNERS TO HAVING DEVELOPED 'USER
FRIENDLY' SYSTEMS.
