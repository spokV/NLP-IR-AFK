THE CONTRIBUTION OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES TO THE ECONOMIC
EXPLOITATION AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE URALS, SIBERIA AND THE FAR EAST.
     
THE LIBRARY SERVICE IN THESE AREAS IS YOUNG, BUT STATISTICS OF USAGE SHOW A
RAPID GROWTH. THE NEED FOR WELL-TRAINED STAFF AND FOR ADEQUATE TRANSPORT HAVE
BEEN KEY FACTORS IN ITS DEVELOPMENT. LIBRARIES THERE SPECIALISE IN INFORMATION
RELEVANT TO THE EXPLOITATION OF THE AREA'S NATURAL RESOURCES AND TO SUCH
PROJECTS AS THE BAIKAL-AMUR RAILWAY, IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL OF
LOCALLY-PRODUCED MATERIAL AND IN LOCAL HISTORY STUDIES. REQUIREMENTS FOR
IMPROVING THE SERVICE INCLUDE' (1) A MORE BALANCED GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
OF SERVICE POINTS; (2) THE REDISTRIBUTION OF SOME STOCK TO ENSURE BETTER
USAGE; (3) THE DISCOVERY, COLLECTION AND CIRCULATION OF MORE LOCAL MATERIAL;
(4) BETTER COOPERATION BETWEEN BOTH LIBRARIES AND LOCAL MUSEUMS.
