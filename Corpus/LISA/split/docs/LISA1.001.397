BIBLIOGRAPHIC ORGANISATION OF U.S. FEDERAL DEPOSITORY COLLECTIONS.

THE GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE PROJECTS A 10% ANNUAL INCREASE IN SALES OVER
FIVE YEARS. RESEARCH ON ACCESSIBILITY TO FEDERAL DOCUMENTS IS SMALL. THIS MAIL
SURVEY, CONDUCTED IN 1979-1980, SOUGHT TO PROVIDE RELIABLE DATA ON STAFF SIZE
AND TYPE, COLLECTION SIZE AND ARRANGEMENT, AND METHODS EMPLOYED TO PROVIDE
DESCRIPTIVE AND SUBJECT ACCESS TO FEDERAL DOCUMENTS IN THE DEPOSITORY SYSTEM.
RESULTS INDICATED THAT ON THE AVERAGE ABOUT 40% OF DEPOSITORY ITEMS WERE BEING
SELECTED YEARLY AND ARRANGED IN SOME FORM OF SEPARATE COLLECTION. 1 IN 4
LIBRARIES DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY DESCRIPTIVE ACCESS; LESS THAN 6% OF THE
LIBRARIES PROVIDE SOME SUBJECT ACCESS. COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY (PARTICULARLY IN
THE FORM OF ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICES) IS MODESTLY USED; ONLY 1/3 OF THE
RESPONDENTS INDICATED SUCH SERVICES WERE AVAILABLE. THERE IS NO CLEAR
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCREASED SELECTION OF FEDERAL DOCUMENTS AND INCREASED
USE OF ON-LINE SERVICE S, EXCEPT IN THOSE LIBRARIES CLAIMING TOTALLY SEPARATE
COLLECTIONS.
