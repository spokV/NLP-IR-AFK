SUCCESSFUL CONVERSION IN MOSS.
     
MOSS LIBRARY, NORWAY, WAS PURPOSE-BUILT IN 1927, BUT UNTIL 1980 OTHER LOCAL
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS OCCUPIED ALL BUT THE GROUND FLOOR. IN 1978 IT BECAME
POSSIBLE TO CONVERT THE WHOLE BUILDING FOR LIBRARY USE. THE LIBRARY NOW
OCCUPIES 1292 SQ.M. ON 3 FLOORS. THE BASEMENT HOUSES STACKS, A STUDY-ROOM AND
A STORY-HOUR ROOM. LENDING DEPARTMENTS OCCUPY THE GROUND FLOOR, AND READING
AND PERIODICALS ROOMS THE 1ST FLOOR. A TOWER WING HOUSES THE LIBRARIAN'S
OFFICE, LOCAL COLLECTION AND MICROFILM EQUIPMENT. WHILE EXTRA SPACE FOR
EXHIBITIONS, STUDY PLACES AND A MUSIC DEPARTMENT WOULD BE VALUABLE, THE
CONVERSION IS FELT TO BE A SUCCESS BY BOTH STAFF AND PUBLIC.
