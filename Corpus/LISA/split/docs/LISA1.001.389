REVISION OF CATALOGUING RULES AGAIN.

THE WORK BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE COMMITTEE FOR DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUING MUST
BE SEEN ON THE BACKGROUND OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH AS IFLA'S WORK
WITH ISBD, AACR2, AND SCANDINAVIAN ATTEMPTS TO REACH COMPATIBILITY WITH
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. THE NEED FOR RULES FOR THE REGISTRATION OF DIFFERENT
MEDIA, WHICH AACR 2 SUPPLIES, IS PRESSING. BUT A DIRECT TRANSLATION OF AACR 2
INTO SWEDISH IS NOT POSSIBLE, AS SOME POINTS NEED DISCUSSION, SUCH AS AACR 2'S
RESTRICTIVE RULES FOR INSTITUTIONS AND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AACR 2 AND SOME
ISBD VARIANTS. THE COMMITTEE HOPES TO PRESENT A MANUAL IN JAN 82. THE
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SHOULD BE ELIMINATION OF DIFFERENCES IN CATALOGUING RULES
FOR RESEARCH AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND MORE RATIONAL USE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
MATERIAL, BOTH NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.
