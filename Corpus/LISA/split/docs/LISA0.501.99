FRENCH IN THE ONTARIO SECONDARY SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL LIBRARIAN.

IN MANY ENGLISH SECONDARY SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN ONTARIO THE COLLECTION OF
MATERIALS TO SUPPORT THE FRENCH PROGRAMME IS MINIMAL, AND EXPOSURE TO THE
FRENCH LANGUAGE AND CULTURE OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM IS DIFFICULT TO ACQUIRE IN
SOME PARTS OF ONTARIO WHERE THERE IS NO LARGE FRENCH POPULATION. EXAMINES THE
SITUATION OF FRENCH IN ONTARIO SCHOOLS AT PRESENT AND TRENDS FOR THE FUTURE,
AND DISCUSSES WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIANS AND MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHERS CAN
COOPERATE, INCENTIVES FOR THE STUDENT, AND TYPES OF MATERIAL WHICH COULD BE
PROVIDED BY THE LIBRARY.
