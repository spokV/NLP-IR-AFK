APPLICATION OF A COMMUNICATING WORD PROCESSOR IN AN INFORMATION DEPARTMENT.
     
A STAND ALONE WORD PROCESSOR (PHILIPS 5002) IS USED TO PRODUCE AN INFORMATION
BULLETIN. A COPY OF THE DATA IS TRANSMITTED FROM THE WORD PROCESSOR TO A
MAINFRAME COMPUTER WHERE IT IS BATCH ASSIMILATED INTO AN ON-LINE DATA BASE.
THE ON-LINE SYSTEM (DECO-UNILEVER COMPUTER SERVICES LTD.) HAS ALL THE FEATURES
OF THE MAJOR COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, IT IS POSSIBLE TO INITIATE THE
GENERATION OF PRINTED INDEXES, EITHER TO THE ENTIRE DATA BASE, OR TO A SUBSET
(HIT-SET) OF DATA, DURING AN ON-LINE SESSION. THE VERSATILITY OF THE WORD
PROCESSOR AND ON-LINE SEARCH SYSTEM ARE ILLUSTRATED DESCRIBING THE VARIOUS
STAGES FROM A SINGLE KEYING STEP, THROUGH TO BULLETIN, DATA BASE, AND PRINTED
INDEX PRODUCTION.
