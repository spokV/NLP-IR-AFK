WISER FROM EXPERIENCE: A STUDY OF PRACTICAL WORK AS AN ELEMENT OF LIBRARY
EDUCATION.

LIBRARY SCHOOL COURSES HAVE FOR A LONG TIME INCLUDED PERIODS OF PRACTICAL WORK
TO ENABLE STUDENTS TO APPLY THEIR THEORETICAL TRAINING TO PRACTICAL SITUATIONS
IN LIBRARIES. SUCH PERIODS MAY TAKE THE FORM OF 'SELF-ORIENTATION' PERIODS,
PROVIDING THE STUDENT WITH ALL-ROUND EXPERIENCE OF LIBRARY TECHNIQUES OR
'EXPERIENCE' PERIODS, DURING WHICH THE STUDENT MAY CARRY OUT DETAILED STUDY OF
A PARTICULAR TOPIC. IN THE NETHERLANDS MOST LIBRARY SCHOOL COURSES ARE TOO
SHORT TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO GAIN MORE THAN A BRIEF VIEW OF LIBRARY ROUTINES IN
PRACTICE. IN ADDITION, STUDENTS OFTEN FAIL TO DERIVE THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT FROM
THEIR PRACTICAL TRAINING BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE PREPARATION BY THE LIBRARY
SCHOOLS AND THE HEAVY WORKLOAD OF COURSE TUTORS. THERE SHOULD BE REGULAR
CONSULTATION BETWEEN STUDENT, COURSE-TUTOR AND TRAINING LIBRARY TO ENSURE THAT
ALL ASPECTS OF PRACTICAL TRAINING ARE BEING COVERED.
