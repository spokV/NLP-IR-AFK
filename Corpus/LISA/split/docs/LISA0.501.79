THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF PUBLIC LIBRARY USER
BEHAVIOR.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHICAL MODEL'
PUBLIC LIBRARY USE IS A FUNCTION OF (1) INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS; (2)
AWARENESS OF LIBRARY SERVICES; (3) PERCEIVED ACCESSIBILITY OF THE LIBRARY; (4)
PERCEIVED EASE OF USE OF THE LIBRARY; AND (5) USE OF OTHER NON-PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. THE MODEL WAS TESTED WITH 4 DIFFERENT LIBRARY USE MEASURES-A
DICHOTOMISED MEASURE OF USE AND NONUSE, AND, AMONG LIBRARY USERS, FREQUENCY OF
USE AND 2-FACTOR ANALYTICALLY DERIVED INDEXES DESCRIPTIVE OF 2 DISTINCTLY
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY USE. TYPE 1 USE APPEARED TO MEASURE USE INTENSITY;
TYPE 2-IN-HOUSE USE. INTERVIEW DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 202 RESIDENTS OF
SYRACUSE, NEW YORK. RESULTS INDICATED THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS PERCEIVED THE
LIBRARY AS MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN DID NONUSERS, AND USE FREQUENCY WAS RELATED TO
AWARENESS OF SPECIAL LIBRARY PROGRAMMES, AS WAS INTENSITY OF USE, AND IN-HOUSE
USE WAS RELATED  TO USE OF OTHER LIBRARIES.
