INFORMATION FOR DISTANCE EDUCATION' THE OPEN UNIVERSITY DISTANCE EDUCATION
INFORMATION PROJECT.

A PROJECT IN PROGRESS AT THE OPEN UNIVERSITY IS STUDYING DISTANCE EDUCATION
INSTITUTIONS AS PLACES OF WORK, WITH THE AIM OF ENABLING MEMBERS TO CONSIDER
IMPLICATIONS FOR INFORMATION PROVISION IN THIS AREA. DESCRIPTIONS WERE
COLLECTED FROM PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF
INSTITUTION, USING THE VIGNETTE METHOD. A DISCUSSION PAPER WILL NOW BE
CIRCULATED TO PARTICIPANTS, PRESENTING THE GENERAL PICTURE WHICH EMERGES AND
RAISING ISSUES FOR INFORMATION PROVISION. THE BURDEN WILL BE THAT, VIEWING
DISTANCE EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. IT IS NOT YET ESTABLISHED AS A
SPECIALISM AND ALSO MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. THIS
SUGGESTS A CURRENT NEED FOR A RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR INFORMATION EXCHANGE,
PROVIDED ON A DECENTRALISED BASIS, AS CONTRASTED WITH FORMAL INFORMATION
STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL FACILITIES FOR DISTANCE EDUCATION AS A WHOLE.
