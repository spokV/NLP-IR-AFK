LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA' PART II LATER DEVELOPMENTS.

PART II OF A 2-PART ARTICLE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN NIGERIA
BASED ON A PAPER PRESENTED TO THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF SINGAPORE, 22 SEPT
78. THE 1ST LIBRARY SCHOOL WAS SET UP AT IBADAN UNIVERSITY IN 1959 WITH A
CARNEGIE CORPORATION GRANT. WITH THE OPENING OF OTHER SCHOOLS IT IS NOW
POSSIBLE TO TRAIN MOST OF THE LIBRARY PERSONNEL NEEDED WITHIN NIGERIA. BESIDES
LEGISLATIONS FOR THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, SOME STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PASSED LAWS
FOR ESTABLISHING LIBRARY SERVICES. LIBRARY PROVISION IS STILL UNEVEN IN
NIGERIA; ACADEMIC LIBRARIES HAVE THE BEST SERVICES AND COLLECTIONS AND THERE
ARE MANY NOTABLE SPECIAL LIBRARIES BUT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES ARE
IMPROVING, ESPECIALLY IN STATES WITH LIBRARY LEGISLATION.
