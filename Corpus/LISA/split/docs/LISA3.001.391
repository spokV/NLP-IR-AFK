A BACKEND MACHINE ARCHITECTURE FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
     
DESCRIBES PROGRESS TO DATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BACKEND MACHINE ARCHITECTURE
FOR LARGE TEXTUAL DATA BASES OR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. OUTLINES THE
USE OF HIGH-SPEED PATTERN MATCHING, STRING PROCESSING, AND OTHER NON-NUMERIC
OPERATIONS FOR THE BASIC SEARCH MODULE. THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE ALSO USED A
STRUCTURED APPROACH AND FUNCTIONAL SEPARATION OF THE PARTS OF THE BACKEND
MACHINE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE HIGH-LEVEL QUERY LANGUAGE, WHICH COMBINES A
LIMITED AMOUNT OF INVERSION WITH SERIAL HIGH-SPEED TEXT PROCESSING IN A
PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED FASHION.
