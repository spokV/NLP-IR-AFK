THE CHRISTIAN LIBRARIAN AND CENSORSHIP: ANOTHER VIEW.

A REPLY TO 'LIBERTY, DEMOCRACY AND CENSORSHIP' THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE
CHRISTIAN LIBRARIAN', CHRISTIAN LIBRARIAN (5) 1981, 29-38 (SEE PREVIOUS
ABSTRACT). RAISES THE FOLLOWING POINTS' THE SECURE BELIEVER CAN MAKE A
DISCRIMINATING JUDGEMENT IN SELECTING MATERIALS, UTILIZING ALL THE MEANS AT
HIS DISPOSAL, EVEN IF IT MEANS INCLUDING THINGS HE STRONGLY DISAGREES WITH;
LIBRARIANS MUST BE ALERT TO THE POWER OF EVIL, BUT TO CONCEAL IT IS NOT TO
DESTROY IT; THE LIBRARIAN SPENDS PUBLIC MONEY, GENERATED FROM PEOPLE OF MANY
FAITHS, WITH DIFFERENT CULTURAL AND MORAL BACKGROUNDS; LIBRARIANS NEED TO BE,
AND TO BE SEEN AS, OPEN PERSONS WHO ARE CONSISTENTLY GRAPPLING WITH THE ISSUES
OF REAL LIFE AS THEY ARE REFLECTED BROADLY IN THE PUBLISHING WORLD; AND
FINALLY, LIBRARIANS SHOULD BEA LIFE-ENHANCING AND A LIFE-AFFIRMING INFLUENCE
AND THE LIBRARY CAN BE A GENUINE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS WHERE 'GOOD' BOOKS MAY
COMPETE WITH THE BAD SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE THERE TOGETHER.
