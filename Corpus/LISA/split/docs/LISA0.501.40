THE BRITISH LIBRARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT'S PUBLIC LIBRARY
RESEARCH PROGRAMME HAS DEVELOPED RAPIDLY SINCE 1978. PROJECTS INCLUDE STATE OF
THE ART REVIEWS, PRELIMINARY OR ENABLING STUDIES, EVALUATION OF EXPERIMENTAL
SERVICES, AND OPERATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECTS. IN ADDITION, PUBLIC LIBRARY
PROJECTS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE RESEARCH CENTRES SUPPORTED BY THE
DEPARTMENT. FUTURE WORK WILL PROBABLY CONCENTRATE MORE ON DISSEMINATION AND
PROMOTION OF RESEARCH RESULTS.
