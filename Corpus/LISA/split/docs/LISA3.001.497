LEARNED SOCIETIES AND JOURNAL PUBLISHING.
     
REPORTS ON A STUDY OF 500 UK LEARNED SOCIETIES. AN INITIAL DISCUSSION IS GIVEN
OF THE HISTORICAL AND PRESENT-DAY ROLES OF LEARNED SOCIETIES AND CURRENT
PERCEPTIONS OF THE RELATIVE ROLES OF COMMERCIAL AND LEARNED SOCIETY
PUBLISHERS. CHARACTERISTICS OF AGE, SIZE AND SUBJECT OF UK LEARNED SOCIETIES
ARE PRESENTED. THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE PAPER IS ON THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF
COOPERATION BETWEEN LEARNED SOCIETY AND OTHER PUBLISHERS. SOME 30% OF UK
LEARNED SOCIETIES COOPERATE WITH PUBLISHERS, TO A MUCH LARGER EXTENT IN
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAN IN THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES.
