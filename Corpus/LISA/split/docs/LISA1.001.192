THE WORK OF THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST.

PAPER PRESENTED TO THE MEETING OF THE CENTRUM VOOR LITERATUURONDERZOEKERS
(CENTRE FOR INFORMATION SPECIALISTS), AMSTERDAM, 15 OCT 80. THE TREND TOWARDS
DECENTRALISATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES IN
INDUSTRIAL ORGANISATIONS AND THE INCREASING USE OF AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES
WILL HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE WORK OF THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST. THE
PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS CONCERNED WITH LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION
SCIENCE MUST PUBLICISE THE WORK OF THEIR MEMBERS MORE EFFECTIVELY IN THE
CENTRES OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND AT INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT TRAINING COURSES. THE
INFORMATION SPECIALIST MUST CONVINCE THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS ORGANISATION THAT
AUTOMATION WILL NOT ENABLE DUTIES NORMALLY PERFORMED IN THE LIBRARY TO BE
TAKEN OVER BY TECHNICAL STAFF. THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST MUST ALSO BE ALLOWED
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POLICY PLANNING OF HIS ORGANISATION.
