2 SEPARATE PROPOSALS LAID BEFORE (1) THE BELGIAN SENATE IN MAR 81, AND (2) THE

GUIDING PRINCIPLE. THE PROPOSALS THEN SET OUT IN DETAIL LARGELY SIMILAR
SUGGESTIONS FOR INSERTION OF AMENDMENTS, WITH COMPREHENSIVE COMMENT ON AND
JUSTIFICATION OF THE POINTS COVERED, WHICH INCLUDE THE NECESSITY FOR AUTHORS'
