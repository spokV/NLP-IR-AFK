THE LIBRARIAN, INFORMATICS, AND THE INTERRELATION BETWEEN PROFESSIONALS
WORKING IN LIBRARIES TODAY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 14TH BRAZILIAN SEMINAR ON INFORMATICS AND LIBRARY
SCIENCE, SAO PAULO, 16-23 OCT 81. THE LIBRARY OF TODAY IS DESCRIBED WITH
REFERENCE TO RECENT ORGANISATIONAL AND TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS, WITHIN THE
CONTEXT OF ITS LONG HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT. TO FULFIL ITS RESPONSIBILITIES OF
COLLECTING, PROCESSING AND DISSEMINATING INFORMATION IN THE 1980S, THE LIBRARY
HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY RELIANT ON INFORMATION ANALYSIS; THE AVAILABILITY OF
NEW TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGY HAS FREED PROFESSIONALS FROM MANY TRADITIONAL
TASKS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING HAS ALTERED GREATLY IN SCOPE AND ORIENTATION.
COMPARES AND CONTRASTS THE ROLES OF THE LIBRARIAN AND THE INFORMATION
SCIENTIST IN A SOCIETY LIKE BRAZIL UNDERGOING RAPID DEVELOPMENT, POINTING OUT
THE POTENTIAL DANGER IN LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM WHEN COMPLEMENTING
COOPERATION IS ESSENTIAL TO MEET ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL NEEDS.
