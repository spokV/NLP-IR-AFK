REDISTRIBUTION ALONE OF THE LIBRARY SCHOOL'S RESOURCES DOES NOT MAKE A SUMMER.

COMMENTS ON A REPORT OF THE WORKING PARTY ON THE DANISH LIBRARY SCHOOL ISSUED
BY THE GOVERNMENT'S DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION. THE REPORT EXAMINES
PROPOSALS FOR CHANGES IN THE LIBRARY SCHOOL ACT. THE PROPOSALS CONCERN A
COMMON BASIC TRAINING FOR LIBRARIANS, THE NEED FOR POST-GRADUATE TRAINING AND
THE ORGANISATION AND CONTENT OF COURSES. FUTURE DEMAND AND SUPPLY OF
LIBRARIANS ARE ESTIMATED. IT IS PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH A SECTION FOR THE BASIC
EDUCATION AND ANOTHER FOR THE OTHER COURSES. AN EDUCATION COUNCIL, APPOINTED
BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE, WITH REPRESENTATIVES FOR ALL INTERESTED
ORGANISATIONS IS SUGGESTED. RESEARCH IS GIVEN HIGHER PRIORITY, ESPECIALLY THAT
LEADING TO DEVELOPMENT FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL LIBRARY SUBJECTS. THE REPORT
RECOGNISES THE DEVELOPMENT WITHIN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION, BUT EXPECTS
THIS TO TAKE PLACE THROUGH CHANGE IN THE PRIORITIES OF THE SCHOOL'S
EXPENDITURE ON PRESENT TASKS AND SEES ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS
POLITICALLY UNREALISTIC.
