TAKING THE LIBRARY OUT OF LIBRARY EDUCATION.
     
LACK OF STATUS IS AN OLD PROBLEM FOR LIBRARIANS, BUT ADOPTING THE NAME OF
INFORMATION MANAGER AND SWITCHING TO INDUSTRY DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A
SOLUTION. SUGGESTS THAT EXTENDING LIBRARY EDUCATION PROGRAMMES TO 2 YEARS MAY

CURRICULA AND MORAL VALUES OF THE PROFESSION WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW
TECHNOLOGIES.
