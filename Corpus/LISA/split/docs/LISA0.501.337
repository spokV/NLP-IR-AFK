BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CONTROL OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES' AN AUTOMATION APPROACH TO
CLASSIFICATION AND CATALOGUING.

TAKES AS A CONCEPTUAL PERSPECTIVE THE USE OF DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO
REPLACE TRADITIONAL PRACTICES OF CLASSIFICATION AND CATALOGUING. ALL ENTRIES
WILL BE MAIN ENTRIES SO AS TO PROVIDE MULTI-ACCESS POINTS TO BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
INFORMATION. CODING FOR MACHINE ENTRY WILL BE THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF A
PUBLICATION, SUCH AS SUBJECT CODE, AUTHOR, TITLE AND DATE. KWIC, BASED ON A
MATCH OF CONTENTS AND USAGE PATTERNS, WILL REPLACE THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS OR
SEAR'S SUBJECT HEADINGS.
