AN ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DENSITY-OF-USE RANKING AND RAW USE
RANKING OF LIBRARY JOURNAL USE.

REPORTS OF JOURNAL TITLES RANKED BY USE WITH SPACE AND COST INFORMATION
INCLUDED FOR EACH TITLE CAN PROVIDE A MEANS FOR MAKING CERTAIN OBJECTIVE
JOURNAL COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS. EACH TITLE CAN BE ASSESSED IN
RELATION TO THE OTHERS AND THE DATA FOR ALL TITLES CAN BE CUMULATED SO THAT
DECISIONS CAN BE MADE AT VARIOUS CUTOFF POINTS. SIMPLE RANKING OF TITLES BY
RAW USE (RUR) MAY BE INADEQUATE AND SHOULD BE ADJUSTED BY SOME MEASURE TO
ALLOW FOR HOW MUCH OF THE TITLE IS AVAILABLE TO THE USER AT THE TIME OF THE
COLLECTION OF THE USE DATA. IF THE RAW-USE FREQUENCY OF A TITLE IS DIVIDED BY
THE ACTUAL LINEAR SHELF SPACE OF THE TITLE'S FILE, A 'DENSITY-OF-USE'
FREQUENCY IS OBTAINED. IF THESE FREQUENCIES ARE THEN RANKED, A 'DENSITY-OF-USE
RANK' (DUR) IS FORMED. SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RUR AND DUR HAVE BEEN
ANALYSED.
