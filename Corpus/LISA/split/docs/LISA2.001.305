THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE LIBRARIAN IN THE TOTAL EDUCATIONAL PROCESS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. EXAMINES THE
EXTENT TO WHICH PROGRAMMES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION HAVE BEEN INTEGRATED
INTO THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS OF THE US COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. REVIEWS THE
DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY INSTRUCTION PROGRAMMES SINCE THE 1930S, AND ARGUES THAT
TRUE INVOLVEMENT IN THE TOTAL EDUCATIONAL PLANNING PROCESS IS STILL UNREALISED
ON A VAST SCALE, AND THAT THE CLASSROOM INSTRUCTOR PREFERS TO REMAIN
INDEPENDENT OF LIBRARIANS WHEN STRUCTURING ACADEMIC PROGRAMMES.
