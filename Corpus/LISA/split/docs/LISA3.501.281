APPLICATION OF INFORMATION THEORY TO THE DESIGN OF LINE-SCAN IMAGING SYSTEMS.
     
INFORMATION THEORY IS USED TO FORMULATE A SINGLE FIGURE OF MERIT FOR ASSESSING
THE PERFORMANCE OF LINE SCAN IMAGING SYSTEMS AS A FUNCTION OF THEIR SPATIAL
RESPONSE (POINT SPREAD FUNCTION OR MODULATION TRANSFER FUNCTION), SENSITIVITY,
SAMPLING AND QUANTIZATION INTERVALS, AND THE STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF A
RANDOM RADIANCE FIELD.
