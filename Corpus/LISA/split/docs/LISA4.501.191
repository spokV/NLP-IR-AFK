THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'FREE' PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
FOR VARIOUS REASONS IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM THEIR AUTHORITIES, IN COMPETITION
WITH OTHER MORE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES ORIGINATED IN THE UK
DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY, THEIR MAIN FUNCTION BEING THE UPLIFTING
OF THE UNEDUCATED. TODAY PUBLIC LIBRARIES MAINLY CONCENTRATE ON THE SUPPLYING
OF LIGHT READING MATTER, ESPECIALLY NOVELS, OF WHICH THE MAJORITY ARE, FROM A
LITERARY POINT OF VIEW, OF A DUBIOUS NATURE. THE ARGUMENTS USED DURING THE
LAST CENTURY TO DEFEND THE PRINCIPLE OF FREE SERVICES ARE NO LONGER VALID
TODAY. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MODERN PUBLIC LIBRARY ARE NEITHER FULLY PART OF
THE WORLD OF EDUCATION NOR THE WORLD OF RECREATION, WITH THE RESULT THAT ITS
IMAGE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS OBSCURE. CONSIDERS THAT, ALTHOUGH CONTINUED
FINANCING OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT IS
NECESSARY, NO VALID OBJECTION CAN BE FOUND TO CHARG E USERS FOR THOSE SERVICES
WHICH ARE NOT ESSENTIAL FOR THE AIMS WHICH THE PUBLIC LIBRARY PURSUES.
