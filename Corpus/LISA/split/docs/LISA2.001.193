STAFFING REFERENCE SERVICE IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' A COST EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR
ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS.
     
(PHD THESIS-TEXAS WOMAN'S UNIVERSITY.) A GENERAL COST EFFECTIVE MODEL IS
DEVELOPED TO TEST STAFFING PATTERNS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY REFERENCE SERVICES.
THE MODEL IS APPLICABLE TO ANY LIBRARY AND PROVIDES EVALUATIVE DATA ON
ALTERNATIVE STAFFING STRATEGIES FOR THE REFERENCE DESK. IT IDENTIFIES 3
IMPORTANT FACTORS' PATRON'S CLASSIFICATION, FREQUENCY OF ARRIVALS, AND TYPES
OF QUESTIONS ASKED; NUMBER OF STAFF AT DESK AND EFFECT OF THEIR SKILL LEVELS
ON FASHION OF SERVICE; AND THE LIBRARY'S POLICY CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF
THE REFERENCE DESK SERVICE. THE PROCEDURE FOR THE MODEL'S IMPLEMENTATION (TO
BE CARRIED OUT BY THE MANAGEMENT) IS BASED ON STATISTICAL DECISION THEORY.
