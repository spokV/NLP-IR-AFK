THE EFFICACITY OF INDEXING SYSTEMS IN RELATION TO UNDER-USAGE OF DOCUMENTATION.

AN EDITED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1980 QUEBEC CORPORATION DES
BIBLIOTHECAIRES PROFESSIONNELS CONFERENCE. THE PROBLEM OF UNDER-USAGE IS
GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED TO OBSOLESCENCE OF DOCUMENTATION AND SOLVED BY WEEDING.
THE PHENOMENON IS MORE COMPLEX AND THE ENTROPY OF A DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM IS
ALSO A RESULT OF INADEQUACIES IN INDEXING, SELECTION SERVICES, AND USER
TRAINING. THE REASONS FOR DECIDING THAT MATERIAL IS OUT OF DATE AND CLOGGING
THE INFORMATION SYSTEM ARE EXAMINED IN DETAIL, TO SHOW HOW MORE EFFICIENT
DOCUMENTATION MANAGEMENT CAN INCREASE USAGE.
