USE STATISTICS: A PLANETARY VIEW.

HISTORICAL STATISTICS FROM THE AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEM WERE PROFILED
AGAINST TOTAL BOOK HOLDINGS AT THE NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER LIBRARY TO
REVEAL INTEREST PATTERNS AND RECENT CHANGES IN USE. THESE STATISTICAL RATIOS
WERE ANALYSED AS A CRITICAL INCREMENT OF AN OVERALL LIBRARY EVALUATION STUDY
TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE LIBRARY MET AND ANTICIPATED NEEDS. THE
ANALYSIS RESULTED IN THE STRENGTHENING OF CERTAIN AREAS; IT INITIATED AN
AUTOMATED CHANGE DETECTION MECHANISM, AND IT ACCELERATED THE DECISION TO STORE
USE HISTORY IN THE MACHINE READABLE SHELFLIST RECORD AS A MANAGEMENT
INFORMATION SYSTEM DATA ELEMENT.
