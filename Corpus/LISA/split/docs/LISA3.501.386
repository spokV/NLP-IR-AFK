ALTERED KEYWORD IN CONTEXT (AKWIC) INDEXING.
     
THE DEFINITION OF KWIC INDEX, ITS ORIGIN AND THE METHOD OF PRODUCTION IS
DESCRIBED. IT IS STRESSED THAT CONTINUITY OF THE CONTEXT AT THE EXTREME EDGES
SHOULD BE MAINTAINED WHENEVER THE BEGINNING OR THE END OF A TITLE FORMS PART
OF A KWIC ENTRY. A MODIFICATION IN THE OUTPUT FORMAT OF THE KWIC INDEX WHICH
CAN BE TERMED THE 'ALTERED KWIC' OR AKWIC INDEX, HAS BEEN SUGGESTED.
ADVANTAGES OF AKWIC OVER KWIC ARE MENTIONED. SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF KWIC
AND AKWIC ARE POINTED OUT. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT ADOPTION OF KWIC INDEX BY
INDIAN PERIODICALS AND ORGANISATIONS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED.
