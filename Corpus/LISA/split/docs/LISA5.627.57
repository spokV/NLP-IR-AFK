INVISIBLE COLLEGES AS A BASIS FOR PLANNING SPECIAL LIBRARY SERVICES. A REVIEW

EXPLAINS HOW INVISIBLE COLLEGES FACILITATE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION AMONG

CAPITALISED ON THIS PHENOMENON. PROPOSES THAT INFORMATION CENTRES IDENTIFY THE
INTERESTS OF USER COMMUNITIES AND KEEP FILES ON THEIR ACTIVITIES,
DISSEMINATING THIS INFORMATION AS PART OF THEIR REFERENCE SERVICES.
