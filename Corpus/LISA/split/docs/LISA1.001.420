VIEWDATA AND THE INFORMATION AGE-PART 2' THEORY INTO PRACTICE.

VIEWDATA APPLICATIONS ARE SAID TO BE DIVIDED INTO 4 MAIN AREAS' RESIDENTIAL,
PUBLIC, BUSINESS, AND SPECIALISED. PREDICTS THAT, WITHIN 3 YEARS, THE RATIO OF
DOMESTIC TO BUSINESS USERS WILL BE AROUND 5 TO 1. VARIOUS APPLICATIONS ARE
DESCRIBED (E.G. VIEWDATA ADAPTED TO HELP THE DEAF COMMUNICATE VIA TELEPHONE).
PARTICULAR REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE USE OF MICROCOMPUTERS AS VIDEOTEX
RECEIVERS (OR VICE VERSA) TO FORM THE BASIS OF TELESOFTWARE. A BRIGHT FUTURE
IS PREDICTED FOR VIEWDATA AND TELETEXT WITH PLENTY OF POTENTIAL FOR DIVERSE
APPLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN COUPLED WITH HOME MICROCOMPUTERS.
