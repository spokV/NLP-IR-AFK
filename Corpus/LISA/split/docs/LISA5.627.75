ADVISORY BODIES IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS.

ADVISORY BODIES AND COMMITTEES DEALING WITH LIBRARIANSHIP IN SLOVAKIA ARE
LISTED. AMONG THE PROBLEMS TACKLED ARE NOT ONLY CATALOGUING, BIBLIOGRAPHY AND
PRESERVATION OF BOOK COLLECTIONS, BUT ALSO STANDARDISATION, RESEARCH AND
STATISTICS IN LIBRARIES, AS WELL AS CONTINUING EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS.
SPECIAL COMMITTEES ATTEND TO THE RUNNING OF PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES, AND
ALSO TO LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THE ENTIRE NETWORK IS HEADED BY THE
SLOVAK LIBRARY COUNCIL ESTABLISHED IN THE 1950S. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE
COUNCIL'S ANNUAL PLANS IS TO MEET THE TARGETS SET BY THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF
CULTURE. FOLLOWING A CAREFUL AND THOROUGH EXAMINATION IN THE COURSE OF THE
CURRENT 5 YEAR PLAN (1981-85), MEASURES WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE UNIFICATION OF
ALL ADVISORY ACTIVITIES AND TO INCREASE THEIR IMPACT ON LIBRARIES.
