SCHOOL LIBRARY AND DOCUMENTATION CENTRES. OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCES.

A GROUP OF 3 ARTICLES, WHICH ORIGINALLY APPEARED SEPARATELY IN 1978 AND 1979
IN BIBLIOTHEQUES CENTRES DOCUMENTAIRES, A FRENCH PERIODICAL, DESCRIBING THE
INTEGRATION OF NEW LIBRARIES INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF FRENCH SCHOOLS, FROM
SEVERAL VIEWPOINTS. IN THE 1ST ARTICLE, 2 PARENTS RECOUNT HOW THE LIBRARY WAS
SET UP, DEVELOPED FUNCTIONS AND ACTIVITIES, AND WAS RECEIVED BY TEACHERS AND
PUPILS. THE 2ND ARTICLE GIVES 2 CONTRASTING ACCOUNTS BY TEACHERS: THE 1ST
SHOWS HOW AFTER INITIAL HESITATION, THE LIBRARY AND SCHOOL FOUND HOW TO ADAPT
TO AND COMPLEMENT EACH OTHERS' ACTIVITIES; THE 2ND DESCRIBES A LESS SUCCESSFUL
PROJECT, WHERE EVENTUALLY FUNCTIONS HAD TO BE PRESCRIBED FOR THE LIBRARY AS A
RESULT OF ITS FAILURE TO DEVELOP ITS OWN SPHERE OF ACTIVITY. THE LAST ARTICLE
DISCUSSES HOW 10 SCHOOLS IN RURAL AREAS ARE PREPARING FOR THE INSTALLATION OF
NEW LIBRARIES, BOTH IN OBTAINING RESOURCES TO ACCOMMODATE THE LIBRARIES AND IN
ALERTIN G STAFF AND PUPILS.
