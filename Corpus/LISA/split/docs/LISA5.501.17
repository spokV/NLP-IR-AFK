E PLURIBUS UNUM-OR NOT?.

CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL FEATURE ON THE FUTURE OF ASSOCIATIONS. IN THE LAST
YEAR THERE HAS BEEN MUCH CONCERN OVER 'TROUBLE' AT THE AMERICAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION HQ. ALA DIVISIONS SEEK GREATER PARTICIPATION IN THE CONDUCT OF
THEIR OWN FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL AFFAIRS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE
THEIR OWN DUES STRUCTURES AND POLICIES, THE RIGHT TO LARGER ALLOCATIONS FROM
ALA'S GENERAL FUND, AND THE RIGHT TO MORE PARTICIPATION IN THE SELECTION OF
THE PERSON HIRED TO REPRESENT THEIR INTERESTS AT ALA HQ. A PROPOSED 'OPERATING
AGREEMENT FOR ALA AND ITS DIVISIONS' ADDRESSES MANY OF THESE CONCERNS, AND IS
THE PRODUCT OF DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN ALA HQ STAFF AND DIVISIONAL OFFICERS.
