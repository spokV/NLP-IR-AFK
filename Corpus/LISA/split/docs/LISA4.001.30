AN IDEA OF LIBRARIANSHIP: AN OUTLINE FOR A ROOT-METAPHOR THEORY IN LIBRARY
SCIENCE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. WITH GROWTH COMES COMPLEXITY; AND LIBRARIANSHIP BECOMES
INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS IT GROWS. A 2-FOLD APPROACH TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF
LIBRARIANSHIP IS SUGGESTED. FIRSTLY, LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A
GENERAL DISCIPLINE AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD BE STUDIED AS A WHOLE, AND
SECONDLY, BASIC COMPONENTS OF LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED, BY REDUCING
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE FIELD TO ITS SIMPLEST PARTS-ITS 'ROOTS'. PROPOSES A
MODEL OF 'METALIBRARIANSHIP' BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS, AND INVOLVING ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT ITS NATURE IN TERMS OF THE MECHANISM, EXPANDED CONTEXTUALISM AND
FORMISM, AND SUGGESTING THAT THE PRIMARY ROOT METAPHOR OF METALIBRARIANSHIP IS
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GENERIC BOOK, ITS SUBJECT MATTER, AND ITS READER.
