LIBRARY SERVICES IN RURAL AREAS OF THE VRACA REGION.
     
FOLLOWING LENIN'S EXHORTATION THAT EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD HAVE A LIBRARY WITHIN
1.5-2 KM FROM HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE, LIBRARY SERVICES IN 3 RURAL DISTRICTS IN
THE MOUNTAINOUS PART OF THE VRACA REGION ARE REVIEWED. THERE ARE ABOUT 36
LOCALITIES AND VILLAGES THERE, BUT ONLY 3 OF THEM HAVE MORE THAN 2,500
INHABITANTS. IN SPITE OF GOOD PUBLIC TRANSPORT, PROVISION MUST BE MADE FOR
PEOPLE WORKING IN REMOTE MINES AND ON SHEEP FARMS. BOOK COLLECTIONS IN LOCAL
PUBLIC LIBRARIES RANGE FROM 3,000-6,000 VOLUMES. AT PRESENT ANNUAL
ACQUISITIONS ARE ON AVERAGE 4.5 VOLUMES PER CAPITA, AGAINST ONLY 0.49 VOLUME
IN 1954. THE TARGET IS 6.5 VOLUMES PER CAPITA. AMONG OTHER PROBLEMS DISCUSSED
ARE THE ASSISTANCE OF THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARY IN VRACA, CENTRALISATION OF
ACQUISITION AND CATALOGUING, DISCARDING OF OBSOLETE LITERATURE AND THE MOST
EFFICIENT USE OF FINANCIAL ALLOWANCES.
