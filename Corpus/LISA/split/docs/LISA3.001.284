THE ROLE OF TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IN THE TRAINING OF USERS.
     
IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA IN 1952 A DECREE WAS PASSED ON THE EXTENSION TRAINING OF
PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS. IT IS THE TASK OF THE BRATISLAVA INSTITUTE OF
EXTENSION TRAINING FOR PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS TO SUPPLY LITERATURE AND
INFORMATION FOR THIS EXTENSION TRAINING. THIS MEANS THE INFORMATION SUPPLY OF
MORE THAN 53 LEARNING GROUPS; ABOUT 2,500 PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS A YEAR.
LITERATURE IS AVAILABLE FOR IN-LIBRARY READING, A LARGE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS
ARE LENT (30,000 UNITS A YEAR). IT IS, HOWEVER, CONSIDERED MORE IMPORTANT TO
TEACH THE PARTICIPANTS OF EXTENSION TRAINING HOW TO USE THE LITERATURE AND
INFORMATION TOOLS THEMSELVES (INCLUDING ABSTRACTING JOURNALS, INDEXES AND
MAGNETIC TAPES).
