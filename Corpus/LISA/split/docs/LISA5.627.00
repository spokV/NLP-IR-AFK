PROVIDING A MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE TO ETHNIC MINORITIES.

A MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE IS ONLY LIKELY TO HAVE TO CATER FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES
IN URBAN AREAS. AFTER THE LOCAL ETHNIC MINORITIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED A
REASONABLE STOCK OF BOOKS IN THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGES MUST BE INCLUDED
BEARING IN MIND THAT SEVERAL ETHNIC MINORITIES ARE ENGLISH-SPEAKING E.G. WEST
INDIANS. STOCKS OF BOOKS FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES MUST PERFORCE BE LIMITED SINCE
ETHNIC MINORITIES ALSO READ BOOKS ORIGINATING FROM THE DOMINANT CULTURE' A
SURFEIT WOULD ALSO ALIENATE THE NON-ETHNIC MINORITY USERS. THE PROBLEM OF
STOCK SELECTION OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE BOOKS CAN BE OVERCOME BY USING ETHNIC
MINORITY STAFF.
