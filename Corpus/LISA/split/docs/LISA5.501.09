LIBRARIES AND CENSORSHIP.

TRANSLATION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1979 BRAZILIAN LIBRARY SCIENCE
CONFERENCE DESCRIBING THE PRESENT SITUATION IN THE USA, WHERE ALTHOUGH STATE
CENSORSHIP OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IS MINIMAL, THE SUBJECT IS 1 OF GREAT
IMPORTANCE TO PRACTISING LIBRARIANS AND IN LIBRARY SCHOOLS. THE ACTIVITIES OF
THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN ESTABLISHING LIBRARY AND READER RIGHTS TO
FREEDOM FROM INTERVENTION ARE DESCRIBED WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE 1948
LIBRARY BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE MCCARTHY PERIOD. IN CONCLUSION, REFERENCE IS
MADE TO THE SITUATION IN BRAZIL, WHERE THE OFFICIAL CENSORSHIP HAS CHANGED,
AND BRAZILIAN LIBRARIANS WARNED TO GUARD AGAINST ANY ENCROACHMENTS ON LIBRARY
FREEDOM.
