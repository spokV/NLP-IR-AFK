IS IT MORE COST-EFFECTIVE TO PRINT ON- OR OFFLINE?.
     
QUESTIONS THE TRADITIONAL ASSUMPTION THAT IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE TO PRINT SEARCH
RESULTS OFF-LINE THAN TO PRINT THEM ON-LINE. DESCRIBES A SIMPLE FORMULA TO
DETERMINE ON-LINE PRINT COSTS FOR COMPARISON WITH OFF-LINE CHARGES FOR 2 MAJOR
DATA BASE VENDORS (LOCKHEED AND SDC). THE EQUATION PERMITS THE CALCULATION OF
THE MAXIMUM CITATION LENGTH AT WHICH OFF-LINE PRINTING BECOMES ECONOMIC.
CONCLUDES THAT WITH LOCAL PRINTING AT 1200 BAUD, THERE IS VERY LITTLE
ADVANTAGE TO PRINTING OFF-LINE.
