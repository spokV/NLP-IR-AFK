PATRON APPROACHES TO SERIALS' A USER STUDY.
     
ALTHOUGH MANY CATALOGUE USE STUDIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED, THOSE LIMITED TO
PATRON SUCCESS WITH LOCATING SERIALS HAVE BEEN UNCOMMON. THIS STUDY, CONDUCTED
AT A SEPARATE SERIAL CARD CATALOGUE IN A MAJOR RESEARCH LIBRARY, MEASURES THE
SUCCESS OF MORE THAN 400 PATRONS IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL OF SERIALS.
THE AUTHORS INTERVIEWED PATRONS AND THEN ANALYZED THE DATA IN AN ATTEMPT TO
DETERMINE HOW PATRONS APPROACH A CARD CATALOGUE WHEN SEARCHING FOR SERIALS,
THEIR SUCCESS RATE, AND REASONS FOR THEIR SUCCESSES AND FAILURES.
