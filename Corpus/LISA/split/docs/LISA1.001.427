EVALUATION OF THE ONLINE SEARCH PROCESS.

THE STUDY EVALUATED ON-LINE SEARCHING PERFORMED ON THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF
MEDICINE SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY IMPLICATIONS FOR TRAINING AND CONTINUING
EDUCATION. SEARCHERS WERE SELECTED WITH FORMAL AND INFORMAL TRAINING, FROM 3
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANISATION, AND WITH DIFFERING LEVELS OF EXPERIENCE. IT
WAS FOUND THAT MOST SEARCHERS HAVE MASTERED THE BASICS OF SEARCHING, AND THAT
PERFORMANCE WAS UNAFFECTED BY SOURCE OF TRAINING, EXPERIENCE, ORGANISATIONAL,
OR EVEN SUBJECT EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND. THE MOST CONSISTENT SOURCE OF
DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE WAS THE DIFFICULTY OF THE SEARCH ITSELF. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
