THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE AS SHOWN BY A LARGE-SCALE CITATION
ANALYSIS.
     
TO COLLECT INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF SECONDARY SERVICES, AN
ANALYSIS OF 59,000 CITATIONS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES WAS CONDUCTED-11,000 TAKEN
FROM 300 MONOGRAPHS, AND 48,000 FROM 140 SERIALS, INCLUDING 47 HIGHLY CITED
TITLES AND 47 TAKEN AT RANDOM. LARGE DIFFERENCES WERE APPARENT BETWEEN
ANALYSES OF REFERENES TAKEN FROM SERIALS AND THOSE FROM MONOGRAPHS, AND
SMALLER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANALYSES OF REFERENCES FROM HIGHLY CITED AND
RANDOMLY CHOSEN SERIALS. THERE WERE ALSO GREAT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SUBJECTS;
MOST OF THESE DIFFERENES HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PLANNING OF SECONDARY
SERVICES. THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT SECONDARY SERVICES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES ARE
DEFICIENT IN THE RANGE OF FORMS OF MATERIAL THEY COVER, IN THE NUMBER AND
POSSIBLY THE SELECTION OF SERIALS COVERED, IN THE SUBJECT SPREAD OF MATERIAL
OF POSSIBLE RELEVANCE, AND PROBABLY ALSO OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE MATERIAL AND
MATERIAL PUBLISHED IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES.
