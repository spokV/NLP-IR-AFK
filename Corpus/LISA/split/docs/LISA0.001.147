THE NEW PLA PLANNING PROCESS.

EXPLANATION OF WHY THE NEW US PUBLIC LIBRARY ASSOCIATION PLANNING PROCESS
EXISTS, WHY WORK HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT ON IT, WHAT THE OLD STANDARDS MEAN, AND
THE CONSIDERATIONS FOR NEW STANDARDS IN THE FUTURE. THE NEW PROCESS VIEWS THE
EXISTING SERVICE PROGRAMME, ESTABLISHES PRIORITIES, AND CONSIDERS
MODIFICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVES WITHIN THE PROGRAMME. WHEN ALL LOCAL SERVICES
ARE COMPETING FOR THE SAME LIMITED MONIES, THE PUBLIC LIBRARY MUST USE THE
PLANNING PROCESS TO GAIN PUBLIC SUPPORT.
