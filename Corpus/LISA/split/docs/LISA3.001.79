A LIBRARY IN BRIXTON.
     
DESCRIBES A VISIT TO THE MAIN PUBLIC LIBRARY IN BRIXTON SHORTLY AFTER THE
RIOTS IN 1981. THE CULTURAL CONTRAST BETWEEN LIFE IN THE STREET AND IN THE
LIBRARY WAS STRIKING. BRIXTON SERVES A POPULATION OF ABOUT 90,000, 25% OF WHOM
ARE USERS. THE LIBRARY EMPHASISES OUTREACH SERVICES AND TEAMWORK AMONG THE 20
STAFF EMPLOYED BY THE MAIN AND 2 BRANCH LIBRARIES. THUS THE LIBRARY SERVES
INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS OLD PEOPLE'S HOMES, HOSTELS FOR THE HOMELESS, YOUTH
CLUBS, PRISONS. HELP IS GIVEN TO ADVICE CENTRES AND 100 PEOPLE ARE VISITED IN
THEIR HOMES. THE CHILDREN'S SECTION CONTAINED FEW BOOKS AND WAS LITTLE USED.
THE RIOTS HAD NOT AFFECTED THE LIBRARY AND GOOD RELATIONS EXISTED WITH THE
YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR LEADERS. THE STOCK INCLUDES BOOKS IN MANY FOREIGN
LANGUAGES FOR THE IMMIGRANT MINORITIES.
