PHOTOGRAPHY: ART FORM OR LEGAL FORUM?.
     
THE INCREASING CRITICAL ACCLAIM GIVEN TO PHOTOGRAPHS HAS RESULTED IN THEIR
BEING EXHIBITED IN MUSEUMS AS A NEW ART FORM, BUT THIS BRINGS LEGAL PROBLEMS
FOR THE MUSEUM. SUBJECTS MAY CLAIM INVASION OF PRIVACY, AND PHOTOGRAPHERS MAY
COMPLAIN OF A VIOLATION OF COPYRIGHT. CAREFUL SIFTING OF LEGAL PRINCIPLES
INVOLVED WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC MATTERS AND ADHERENCE TO REGULATED PROCEDURES
REDUCES THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR VEXATIONS CLAIMS TO MANAGEABLE
PROPORTIONS. OUTLINES WHAT THE REGISTRAR CAN DO BY REVIEWING THE PHOTOGRAPHS
AND ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS TO MINIMISE THE MUSEUM'S EXPOSURE TO THE HAZARDS OF
INVASION OF PRIVACY.
