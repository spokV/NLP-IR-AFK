USE OF A CATALOGING CENTER'S BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS AS A MEANS TO CHECK AND
BALANCE ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITIES AT AN ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARY.
     
THE ACQUISITIONS STAFF AT WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY'S SHIFFMAN MEDICAL LIBRARY
HAS DEVELOPED A VALIDATION SYSTEM BASED ON THE REQUESTS FOR CATALOGUING FROM
THE 5 TEACHING HOSPITALS WHICH ARE MEMBERS OF THE DETROIT COOPERATIVE
CATALOGING CENTER (DC3). DC3 PROVIDES DATA ON MEMBERS' ACQUISITION ACTIVITES
WHICH HAVE ASSISTED IN POINTING UP DEFICIENCIES IN SHIFFMAN'S BOOK BUDGET, AND
IN ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF SELECTIVE PURCHASING IN THE FACE OF FISCAL
CONSTRAINTS. THIS SYSTEM IS BEING USED TO GENERATE THE KIND OF INFORMATION
NEEDED BY BOTH ACQUISITIONS LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS IN ORDER TO
MAKE INFORMED COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM
NTIS.
