SOME ASPECTS OF THE LIBRARIAN-USER RELATIONSHIP.

ARGUES THAT DIRECT LIBRARIAN-USER INTERACTION IS LONG OVERDUE FOR CLOSE
SCRUTINY, SINCE THIS RELATIONSHIP MAY NOT BE IN HARMONY WITH THE OVERALL
STANDARD OF OTHER SUBSYSTEMS OF THE INFORMATION CENTRE. POINTS OUT THAT, APART
FROM QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE, A LIBRARIAN MUST ALSO POSSESS A
PERSONALITY WHICH IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY WELL BALANCED AND ADAPTABLE, SINCE A
GREAT DEAL OF HIS/HER WORK INVOLVES EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY STRESSFUL
SITUATIONS. THESE SITUATIONS ARISE WITH USERS WHO ARE POORLY INFORMED ABOUT
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINING A PARTICULAR INFORMATION
SOURCE AND WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE THAT OTHER READERS HAVE THEIR
PRESSING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. NAME TAGS FOR LIBRARIANS SHOULD LEAD TO GREATER
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. IN LARGE LIBRARIES DIRECT USER CONTACT INVOLVES SHIFT
WORKING FOR THE PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE STAFF; THIS LEADS TO DIFFICULTIES AND
SOMETIMES LESS THAN ADEQUATE PERSONNEL ARE EXPOSED TO THE PU BLIC. THIS AREA
OF LIBRARY SERVICES CRIES OUT FOR A SYSTEMATIC OVERHAUL.
