PUBLIC TERMINAL USE IN AN ONLINE CATALOG: SOME PRELIMINARY RESULTS.

A STUDY OF THE TRANSACTION COUNTS FOR 2 1/2 YEARS' ACTIVITY AT THE PUBLIC USE
TERMINALS OF THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' PROTOTYPE ON-LINE CARD
CATALOGUE TO DETERMINE WHAT SEARCH OPTIONS ACADEMIC LIBRARY PATRONS USE THE
MOST OFTEN AND WHETHER THIS PATTERN VARIES FROM THAT REPORTED IN MAJOR
CATALOGUE USE STUDIES. THE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS INDICATE SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES IN SEARCH STRATEGY THAT MAY RESULT FROM A UNIQUE USER GROUP THAT
PREFERS TO SEARCH THE ON-LINE CATALOGUE, MORE USEFUL SEARCHES IN THE ON-LINE
SYSTEM, OR SPECIAL SEARCH PATTERNS IMPOSED BY THE COMPUTER HARDWARE ITSELF.
BOTH THE DIFFERENT SEARCHES USED BY PATRONS AND WHY THEY CHOSE THEM SHOULD BE
IMPORTANT FACTORS IN THE DESIGN OF FUTURE ON-LINE CATALOGUES.
