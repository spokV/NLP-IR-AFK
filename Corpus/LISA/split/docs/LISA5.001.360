NATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SERIALS.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CANADIAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF
COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES TECHNICAL SERVICES COORDINATING GROUP
WORKSHOP, VANCOUVER, B.C., 14 JUNE 80. IN THE EARLY 1970S 2 NATIONAL TASK
GROUPS RECOMMENDED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL SERIALS DATA BASE IN
CANADA. TO CREATE A DATA BASE LIBRARIES MUST SHARE DATA ABOUT SERIALS.
STANDARDS ARE A PRE-REQUISITE TO SHARING DATA-A STANDARD DEFINITION OF A
SERIAL, THE ISSN, THE MARC FORMAT, STANDARDS FOR HOLDINGS STATEMENTS AND
LIBRARY SYMBOLS AND CATALOGUING STANDARDS. USE OF STANDARD SOURCES OF DATA
ALSO FACILITATES SHARING. A NATIONAL SERIALS DATA BASE NOW EXISTS IN CANADA ON
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOBIS SYSTEM JOINTLY MAINTAINED BY THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
OF CANADA AND THE CANADA INSTITUTE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION.
DATA ON HOLDINGS OF MAJOR CANADIAN LIBRARIES ARE COLLECTED AND EDITED IN A
CENTRAL LOCATION.
