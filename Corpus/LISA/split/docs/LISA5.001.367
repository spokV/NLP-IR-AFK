SOME CURRENT ISSUES IN PLANNING FOR LIBRARY AUTOMATION AT THE STATE LEVEL.

THE CONNECTICUT AUTOMATION COORDINATING COMMITTEE (CACC) WAS FORMED IN 1980 TO
PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL GROUPS, LIBRARIES AND ORGANISATIONS ENGAGED IN
OR INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING AUTOMATED SYSTEMS TO MEET REGULARLY TO SHARE
INFORMATION AND TO BEGIN AN INFORMAL PLANNING EFFORT. DISCUSSES MAJOR ISSUES
THAT THE CACC HAS FACED WHICH HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER STATES. A STATEWIDE
ON-LINE UNION CATALOGUE IS LIKELY TO CONSIST OF COMPONENTS DEVELOPED
INDEPENDENTLY BY INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES OR GROUPS OF LIBRARIES WHICH HAVE
VOLUNTARILY ADOPTED GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS SUGGESTED BY THE CACC. THE ROLE
OF THE CACC IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF EXISTING AND EMERGING CATALOGUES WHICH
MIGHT BECOME COMPONENTS, THE PROMOTION OF ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THOSE COMPONENTS
AND THE ASSURANCE THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE PROSPECT OF EVENTUAL LINKAGE AND
INTEGRATION OF THOSE COMPONENTS.
