TECHNOLOGY.
     
REPORTS THE RESULTS OF 3 YEARS STUDY AT SOUTHAMPTON UNIVERSITY. THE ATTITUDES
OF UNIVERSITY RESEARCH WORKERS, GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONS, LEARNED SOCIETIES,
CHARITIES, COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY WERE STUDIED BY INTERVIEW, STRUCTURED
SEMINARS AND POSTAL QUESTIONNAIRES. CONCLUDES THAT ALL UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
WORKERS AND MANY MEMBERS OF ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF ORGANISATION STUDIED NEED
TO MAINTAIN AN UP-TO-DATE KNOWLEDGE OF RESEARCH WORK IN PROGRESS AND THIS IS
TRUE OF ALL DISCIPLINES. A MAJORITY OF THE NEEDS EXPRESSED WOULD BE MET BY THE
PUBLICATION OF A SUCCESSOR TO THE BRITISH LIBRARY PUBLICATION 2SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH IN BRITISH UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES1 WITH AS WIDE A BASE AS POSSIBLE
OF RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS, WITH MINOR EDITORIAL CHANGES AND A MAJOR
IMPROVEMENT IN PUBLISHING TIME-LAG.
