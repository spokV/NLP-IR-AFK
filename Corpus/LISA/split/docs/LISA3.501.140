CO-AUTHORSHIP AS COMMUNICATION MEASURE.
     
THE ENTROPY MEASURE FOR INFORMATION FOR DETERMINING THE CONTRIBUTION MADE BY
AUTHORS IN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS REFINED AND APPLIED. HIGHLY COLLABORATIVE
AUTHORS ARE FOUND TO BE HIGHLY PROLIFIC. IN COMPUTATIONAL MUSICOLOGY, HOWEVER,
PRODUCTIVITY DOES NOT IMPLY COLLABORATION, LENDING CREDENCE TO THE TRADITIONAL
BELIEF THAT HUMANISTS TEND TO WORK ALONE.
