CAN WE SERIOUSLY BELIEVE IN THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF ARCHIVES AND RECORDS
MANAGEMENT IN NORTH AMERICA?.
     
ARGUES THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF RECORDS AND ARCHIVES ARE 2 DISTINCT OCCUPATIONS,
AND NOT 2 SPECIALIST BRANCHES OF THE ARCHIVE PROFESSION. ACKNOWLEDGES THE
DESIRABILITY OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE 2, AND EXAMINES THE CONTRIBUTION OF
EACH DEPARTMENT TO THE OTHER, BUT CONCLUDES THAT THE ATTEMPT TO ANNEX THE
FIELD OF RECORDS MANAGEMENT TO ARCHIVE ADMINISTRATION IS ULTIMATELY AN ATTEMPT
TO CREATE A MODERN IMAGE FOR THE PROFESSION BY IMPORTING EUROPEAN TERMINOLOGY
INAPPROPRIATE TO THE NORTH AMERICAN ACTUALITY.
