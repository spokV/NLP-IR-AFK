RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY AND THE ROYAL LIBRARY.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
WITHIN A COUNTRY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'
HELD IN MOSCOW, 21-22 NOV 78. OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SWEDISH-RUSSIAN
LIBRARY COOPERATION DURING THE PAST 20 YEARS. AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THIS
RESPECT WAS THE BILATERAL EXCHANGE AGREEMENT IN 1964 WHICH BECAME THE MAINSTAY
OF THE ROYAL LIBRARY'S RUSSIAN COLLECTION. ALTHOUGH THE GOSUDARSTVENNAYA
PUBLICHNAYA BIBLIOTEKA SSSR IM. V.I. LENINA (LENIN STATE LIBRARY) IS THE
LARGEST PARTNER, COOPERATION IS ALSO ESTABLISHED WITH OTHER LIBRARIES IN THE
USSR. OVER THE YEARS MANY PERSONAL CONTACTS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BETWEEN
RUSSIAN AND SWEDISH LIBRARIANS AND EXTENSION ACTIVITIES, BASED ON MATERIALS
FROM THE USSR ORGANISED.
