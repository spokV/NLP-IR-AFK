THE ACCURACY OF TELEPHONE REFERENCE SERVICES IN THE SOUTHEAST' A CASE FOR
QUANTITATIVE STANDARDS.

THE TELEPHONE REFERENCE SERVICES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES IN THE 9 SOUTHEASTERN STATES OF THE USA WERE INVESTIGATED USING
THEIR RESPONSES TO 12 FACT-SEEKING TELEPHONE QUERIES MADE OVER A 12-MONTH
PERIOD, THEIR 1975 LIBRARY GENERAL INFORMATION SURVEY DATA, AND A
QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY INDEPENDENT VARIABLES RELATED TO REFERENCE
SERVICES. ONLY 50% OF THE TEST QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED CORRECTLY. INDEPENDENT
VARIABLES SUCH AS SERVICE HOURS OR VOLUMES HELD WERE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO
ACCURACY OF RESPONSE THAN VARIABLES CONCERNED WITH STAFF, INDICATING THAT
STAFF ABILITY TO EXPLOIT A COLLECTION IS MORE CRUCIAL THAN STAFF NUMBERS.
CONCLUDES THAT THESE RESULTS SUPPORT CALLS FOR QUANTITATIVE STANDARDS FOR
REFERENCE SERVICES.
