THE VIDEO MEDIUM AND THE LIBRARIES' FUTURE PROVISION OF PICTURES.
     
DESCRIBES THE GROWTH OF VIDEO FILMS. CALLS FOR A FORUM OF LIBRARIANS WHO CAN
INITIATE PILOT PROJECTS AND EXAMINE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF VIDEO IN RELATION TO
LIBRARIES. AS THIS MEDIUM IS CONSIDERABLY CHEAPER TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE
THAN FILMS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT LIBRARIES COOPERATE WITH OTHER CULTURAL
INSTITUTIONS IN SECURING A QUALITY PRODUCTION TO COUNTERACT THE PRESENT LOW
QUALITY OUTPUT. THE MEDIUM ALSO RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF LIBRARIES
ESTABLISHING WORKSHOPS WHERE EVERYONE CAN USE EQUIPMENT FOR VIDEO PRODUCTION.
DESCRIBES A PROJECT LIBRARY AND VIDEO IN HVIDOVRE PUBLIC LIBRARIES, IN APR 80.
VIDEO PROGRAMMES WERE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE LIBRARY'S VIDEO COLLECTION AND
THROUGH A VIDEO WORKSHOP, IN WHICH THE PUBLIC WERE ENCOURAGED TO EXPERIMENT
WITH THE EQUIPMENT THEMSELVES.
