USER EVALUATION OF A CORPORATE LIBRARY ONLINE SEARCH SERVICE.
     
THE RESPONSES TO AN EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRE ADMINISTERED PRIMARILY TO
1ST-TIME AND REMOTE-SITE USERS OF A CORPORATE LIBRARY ON-LINE SEARCH SERVICE
INDICATED THAT THE SEARCHES YIELD A HIGH % OF RELEVANT CITATIONS FOR MOST
USERS. A FURTHER CORRELATION BETWEEN THE USERS' RESPONSES TO BROAD RELEVANCE
CATEGORIES AND THEIR PRESENCE AT THE TERMINAL DURING THE SEARCH RECONFIRMED
THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERACTIVE FEEDBACK BETWEEN THE USER AND THE SEARCH
INTERMEDIARY IN IMPROVING SEARCH PRECISION. THE STUDY IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANT
TIME SAVINGS BY THE USERS. MOST RESPONDENTS ENDORSED THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF
THE SERVICE, PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVED IN ONGOING RESEARCH PROJECTS OR
STARTING A NEW PROJECT.
