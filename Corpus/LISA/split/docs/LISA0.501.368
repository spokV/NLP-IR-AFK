WITHIN THE BRITISH LIBRARY PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO CURRENT USE OF

SERVICES BOTH WITHIN THE UK AND ABROAD. PRECIS AND THE BRITISH MUSEUM SUBJECT
INDEX, THEIR RESPECTIVE COSTS, EASE OF USE, AND POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE
DEVELOPMENT ARE ALSO CONSIDERED, PARTICULARLY THE MACHINE-MANIPULATION OF
PRECIS STRINGS TO PRODUCE SUBJECT HEADINGS VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE ALREADY USED
IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM SUBJECT INDEX. CONCLUDES WITH A SUMMARY OF
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS OF THE WORKING PARTY.
