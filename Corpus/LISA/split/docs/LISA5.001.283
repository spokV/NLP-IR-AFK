THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN COURT.

A SUMMARY OF SOME US COURT CASES INVOLVING MATERIALS IN SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA
CENTRES WHICH HAVE SET PRECEDENTS. THESE CASES OFFER 3 GUIDELINES FOR MEDIA
SPECIALISTS' THEY NEED TO KNOW THE EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY OF THEIR SCHOOLS AND
COMMUNITIES; WHEN SELECTING MATERIALS THAT MIGHT INVITE CHALLENGES, LIBRARIANS
NEED TO SEE THAT THE MATERIALS ARE KEYED TO SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES;
AND THESE CASES RE-EMPHASISE THE NEED FOR SCHOOL BOARDS TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT
PROCEDURES FOR THE HANDLING OF COMPLAINTS CONCERNING INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS.
