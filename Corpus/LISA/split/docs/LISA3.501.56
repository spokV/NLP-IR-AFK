DOCUMENTATION AS A PART OF THE SYLLABUS AT DUTCH LIBRARY SCHOOLS.
     
THE TERM 'DOCUMENTATION' WAS 1ST USED BY PAUL OTLET OF THE INSTITUT
INTERNATIONAL DE BIBLIOGRAPHIE IN 1905. OTLET REGARDED 'BIBLIOGRAPHY' AS TOO
RESTRICTED A TERM TO COVER HIS ACTIVITIES. WITH THE INCREASING USE OF
AUTOMATED SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES IN THE 1960S USE OF THE TERM 'DOCUMENTATION'
HAS BECOME MORE FREQUENTLY APPLIED TO CERTAIN TASKS IN ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES.
IT IS THEREFORE UNREALISTIC TO CONSIDER LIBRARIANSHIP AND DOCUMENTATION AS
SEPARATE DISCIPLINES. AT THE FREDERIK MULLER SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN
AMSTERDAM, DOCUMENTATION IS TAUGHT AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE COURSE FOR
ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS. THE SUBJECT OCCUPIES 20% OF THE SYLLABUS AND INCLUDES
SUBJECT INDEXING, INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND ABSTRACTING TECHNIQUES.
