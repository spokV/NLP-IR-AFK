THE AMALGAMATION OF A SMALL AND A LARGER LIBRARY.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITY OF VLAGTEWEDDE, WHICH WITH A
POPULATION OF 16,500 INHABITANTS WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPELLED UNDER THE DUTCH
PUBLIC LIBRARY ACT TO SURRENDER ITS LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE COUNTY COUNCIL,
COMBINED IN 1978 WITH THE NEARBY TOWN OF STADSKANAAL WITH A POPULATION OF
34,000 TO PROVIDE A JOINT LIBRARY SERVICE. THE COMBINED LIBRARY SERVICE NOW
HAS ITS MAIN LIBRARY AT STADSKANAAL, 5 BRANCH LIBRARIES AND A MOBILE LIBRARY
WITH A TOTAL COLLECTION OF APPROXIMATELY 135,000 BOOKS AND RECORDS. THERE ARE
16,600 REGISTERED BORROWERS AND LOANS IN 1980 TOTALLED 750,000. LIBRARY
SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE REGION HAVE BEEN IMPROVED BY THE CREATION OF
DOCUMENTATION CENTRES IN SCHOOLS AND BY THE SETTING UP OF A LIBRARY SERVICE
FOR HOUSEBOUND READERS.
