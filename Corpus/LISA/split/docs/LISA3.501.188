PRICING OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES.
     
OPPORTUNITIES AND PROBLEMS CONFRONTING A PUBLIC LIBRARY IN ITS PRICING
DECISION ARE RELATED TO ITS PRICING OBJECTIVES. EXAMINES 6 OBJECTIVES OF PRICE
AND IDENTIFIES THE LIKELY OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OBJECTIVE. THESE
OBJECTIVES ARE MARKET EQUITY, SOCIAL EQUITY, MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY FOR
PARTICIPATION, MAXIMISING REVENUE, RATIONING, AND COMMERCIAL SECTOR
ENCOURAGEMENT. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A LIBRARY WILL HAVE ONE OVERALL PRICING
OBJECTIVE WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO ALL THE SERVICES IT DELIVERS. THE PRICE
ULTIMATELY ADOPTED FOR ANY PARTICULAR SERVICE WILL DEPEND ON WHICH OBJECTIVES
ARE UPPERMOST IN PRIORITY AND WILL REPRESENT THE BEST COMPROMISE AMONG
CONFLICTING OBJECTIVES.
