ON THE ART OF MANAGEMENT IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES' A PROLEGOMENON.
     
DISCUSSES 3 ASPECTS OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY MANAGER'S RESPONSIBILITY' MANAGING
RELATIONS OF THE LIBRARY WITH THE REST OF THE INSTITUTION (INVOLVING THE
LIBRARY IN THE FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INSTITIONAL OBJECTIVES);
MANAGING CONFLICTS WITHIN THE LIBRARY (THE MOST APPROPRIATE ATTITUDE BEING A
CONSULTATIVE ADMINISTRATIVE STYLE DISTINGUISHED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF
AUTHORITY RATHER THAN RELIANCE ON LEGISLATED POWER); AND MANAGING CHANGES
WROUGHT BY TECHNOLOGY (PERCEIVING TECHNOLOGY AS A MORE EFFICIENT MEANS FOR
OBTAINING THE LIBRARY'S TRADITIONAL GOALS).
