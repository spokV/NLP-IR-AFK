INFORMATION SERVICES, POPULAR CULTURE, AND THE LIBRARIAN' PROMOTING A
CONTEMPORARY LEARNING PERSPECTIVE.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO POPULAR CULTURE AND LIBRARIES. EXAMINES
THE ROLE OF BOTH THE PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN AS SOURCES OF COMPREHENSIVE
INFORMATION SERVICE TO ALL PATRONS, CONTENDING THAT EFFECTIVE SERVICE MUST BE
GUIDED BY 2 KEY PRINCIPLES' (1) THE GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PURSUITS OF
CONTEMPORARY PEOPLE ARE INNER-DIRECTED AND DESERVE ACCESS TO AN UNRESTRICTED
STORE OF INFORMATION; AND (2) LIBRARIES MUST PROVIDE THE BROADEST POSSIBLE
SPECTRUM OF MATERIALS SO THAT THE PUBLIC WILL PERCEIVE THE LIBRARY AS A
REASONABLE, RELIABLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE FOR ALL TYPES OF
INFORMATION NEEDS.
