JOB PERMANENCY: THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN'S DILEMMA IS THE ADMINISTRATOR'S
CHALLENGE FOR THE 1980S.

THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY IS BECOMING A NO-MOVEMENT, STABLE FACULTY WITH EVERYONE
AFRAID, FINANCIALLY UNABLE, OR PROFESSIONALLY INCAPABLE OF MOVING. THE LIBRARY
MANAGER COULD STOP THE FACULTY DYING AND HELP STAFF TO DEVELOP PROFESSIONALLY
BY PROVIDING CONTRACT OPTIONS, CHANGING STAFFING PATTERNS, ROTATING PERSONNEL,
OFFERING LEAVE OF ABSENCE, AND IMPROVING THE WORK ENVIRONMENT.
