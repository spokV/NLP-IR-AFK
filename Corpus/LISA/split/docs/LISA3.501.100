OBSERVATIONS ON READER BEHAVIOUR IN A COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY.
     
THE 10 COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES IN NORTH RHINE WESTPHALIA HAVE A TOTAL
STOCK OF 850,000 ITEMS FOR OVER 50,000 STUDENTS AND 2,000 TEACHERS; IN 1980-81
THEIR LIBRARY BUDGETS AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN 3 MILLION DM. LOANS HAVE RISEN
STEADILY SINCE 1974 OWING TO LARGER BOOK STOCKS, LONGER OPENING HOURS, MORE
INSTRUCTION FOR STUDENTS IN THE USE OF SUBJECT LITERATURE AND THE DEVELOPMENT
OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN SCHEMES. IN CONTRAST WITH THE UNIVERSITIES, THE MAJORITY
OF DEMANDS FOR EXTERNAL MATERIAL CAME FROM STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY EXAMINATION
CANDIDATES, RATHER THAN FROM TEACHERS. THE ORDERING OF MONOGRAPHS IS
INCREASING BUT PERIODICALS ARE THE TYPE OF LITERATURE MOST IN DEMAND. IT IS
VITAL THAT ALL COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO NATIONAL
INTERLOAN SCHEMES.
