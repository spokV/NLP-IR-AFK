BUT AN AUTHORITY SHOULD EXIST TO UNDERTAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS
OF THE PRESERVATION, PROCESSING, MAINTENANCE, AND RESTORATION OF UNPUBLISHED
MANUSCRIPTS AND TO MAKE THEM KNOWN WORLD-WIDE. ALECSO (ARAB LEAGUE
EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION) SHOULD BE THE AUTHORITY,
WORKING THROUGH ITS INSTITUTE OF ARAB MANUSCRIPTS AND DEPARTMENT OF
DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION. DESCRIBES THE CURRENT ACTIVITIES OF THESE 2
ESTABLISHMENTS.
