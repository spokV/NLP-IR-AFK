INFOTERRA: AN INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION NETWORK.

INFOTERRA (INTERNATIONAL REFERRAL SYSTEM FOR SOURCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL
INFORMATION) WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME AS
PART OF EARTHWATCH, ITS PROGRAMME FOR THE CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE GLOBAL
ENVIRONMENT. IN OPERATION SINCE JAN 77, IT HAS A DECENTRALISED STRUCTURE AND
ITS NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND SECTORIAL FOCAL POINTS AND THE INFOTERRA PROGRAMME
ACTIVITY CENTRE ACT AS SWITCHBOARDS, CONNECTING USERS WITH APPROPRIATE
INFORMATION SOURCES OR (IF THEIR RESOURCES ALLOW) SOMETIMES PROVIDING
INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THE USER. INFOTERRA IS NOT A SUBSTANTIVE INFORMATION
SYSTEM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE DOCUMENTS. AFTER INITIAL HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE
SYSTEM, DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE NOW MAJOR PARTICIPANTS AND INFOTERRA IS
ENCOURAGING AND HELPING THEM TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL
INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
