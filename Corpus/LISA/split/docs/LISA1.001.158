THE USE OF EMPIRICAL STANDARDS IN ASSESSING PUBLIC LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS.

REPORTS RESEARCH CARRIED OUT IN 1977-78 IN WHICH MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS
WAS USED TO TEST THE PERFORMANCE OF (MAINLY) RESOURCE VARIABLES IN EXPLAINING
THE LEVEL OF CIRCULATION IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA. CONCLUDES
THAT' THE LEVELS OF THE VARIABLES EXPLAIN VERY HIGH PROPORTIONS OF THE
VARIANCE OF LIBRARY USE; RESEARCHERS ARE NOT YET JUSTIFIED IN CALLING THE
OBSERVED RELATIONSHIPS INPUT-OUTPUT FUNCTIONS; AND, DESPITE THIS, THE STRENGTH
OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS PROVIDES A POWERFUL TOOL FOR COMPARING PERFORMANCES OF
LIBRARIES AND FOR PREDICTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF A GIVEN LIBRARY.
