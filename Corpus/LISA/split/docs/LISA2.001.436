LINKING EDUCATORS TO THEORY' CASE STUDIES OF PART-TIME INFORMATION CONSULTANTS.
     
THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EXPERIENCES OF 4 LOCAL EDUCATORS WHO SERVED AS
INFORMATION CONSULTANTS LINKING THEIR CLIENTS WITH ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RETRIEVAL SERVICES. 4 EDUCATORS IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS AND SETTINGS, BUT IN
THE SAME GEOGRAPHICAL AREA REMOTE FROM TORONTO, WERE TRAINED TO LINK THEIR
CLIENTS WITH THE EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER FOR ONTARIO (EISO), A
CENTRALISED, ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RETRIEVAL SERVICE. A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED
THAT DESCRIBED THE ACTUAL AND IDEAL LINKAGE ROLES, THE EFFECT OF THESE ROLES
ON THE SATISFACTION OF CLIENTS WITH THE INFORMATION SERVICE, AND THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS FOR THE DISSEMINATION OF EDUCATIONAL KNOWLEDGE.
