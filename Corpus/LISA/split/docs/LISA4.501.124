GERMANICI MONACENSES, 1IN THE BAVARIAN STATE LIBRARY, ABOUT 2/3 OF WHICH CAME
TO MUNICH THROUGH THE SECULARISATION OF THE MONASTERIES. THE GERMAN CODICES
FORM ONLY ABOUT 4% OF ALL THE MONASTIC COLLECTIONS OF MANUSCRIPTS, WHICH DATE
MOSTLY FROM THE 15TH CENTURY. DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS ARE GIVEN OF STOCKS FROM'
THE PUTRICH MONASTERY, MUNICH; TEGERNSEE; REBDORF; ST. EMMERAN IN REGENSBURG;
AND THE AUGUSTINE AND FRANCISCAN MONASTERIES IN MUNICH. SUBJECT CONTENTS
INCLUDE THE RULES OF THE ORDERS, PRAYER AND MEDITATION, DIDACTIC FABLES,
CHRONICLES, LEGAL MATERIAL AND SECULAR LITERATURE, ALL OF INTEREST TO AN
INTERNATIONAL LAY PUBLIC. MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT MANUSCRIPT ORIGINS STILL REMAIN
OPEN.
