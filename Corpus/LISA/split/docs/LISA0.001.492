LIBRARIES: CULTURAL ROLE AND THE PROBLEMS OF LIBRARIANSHIP.

CONSISTS OF PART OF K.I. RUBINSKII'S 1909 LECTURE AT KHARKOV UNIVERSITY.
LIBRARIES DESERVE SERIOUS STUDY AS FACTORS IN HUMAN CULTURE. THEY ARE A
COUNTRY'S MOST VALUABLE ASSET. LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BECOME A UNIVERSITY
SUBJECT AS IT EVOLVES THE BEST METHODS OF DISSEMINATING KNOWLEDGE.
LIBRARIANSHIP NEEDS TO STUDY THE WORK OF PEOPLE'S AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES,
LIBRARY HISTORY, STATISTICS, BOOK CONSERVATION, LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND STAFF
TRAINING. LIBRARIES MUST HELP ALL THOSE TURNING TO THEM AS A SCHOOL. HOWEVER,
UNTRAINED STAFF WILL HAMPER THIS. THE PEOPLE'S WAGES CREATED LIBRARIES, USE OF
THEM IS THEIR RIGHT.
