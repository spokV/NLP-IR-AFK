WHITHER SAILIS? THOUGHTS ON THE ROLE OF THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION.

THE FOUNDING OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
SCIENCE (SAILIS) AS A NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATION HAS BEEN FAVOURABLY
RECEIVED NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. ITS STRUCTURE WILL BE DEVELOPED IN
THE COMING YEARS TO FOLLOW EFFECTIVELY THE 2 BASIC PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN DURING
ITS PLANNING: THAT THE ENTIRE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PROFESSION BE CATERED
FOR BY A CENTRAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATION, AND THAT PROVISION BE MADE FOR
FULL DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS AND REALISATION OF ASPIRATIONS OF EVERY GROUP IN
THE PROFESSION. HOPES THAT SAILIS WILL SERIOUSLY CONSIDER A NATIONAL LIBRARY
AND INFORMATION NETWORK AND CALLS FOR A PENETRATING ENQUIRY INTO THE NATURE
AND SCOPE OF NATIONAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION FUNCTIONS.
