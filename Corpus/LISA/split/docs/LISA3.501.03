INTERNATIONALISM' AND THE CHILDREN'S LITERATURE COMMUNITY IN THE UNITED
STATES: A SECOND LOOK.P
     
APER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TERM
'INTERNATIONALISM' AS IT IS USED BY THOSE IN THE FIELD OF CHILDREN'S
LITERATURE IN THE USA. IT IS MOST COMMONLY APPLIED TO THOSE ACTIVITIES WHICH
CENTRE ON SOME PHASE OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. ITS USE
APPEARS WITH GREATER FREQUENCY IN ARTICLES ON CHILDREN'S LITERATURE AND
SEMINAR PROGRAMMES. EXAMINATION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE TEXTBOOKS, THEMES FOR
DOCTORAL THESES PRESENTED 1930-79, AND THE STATUS OF LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS IN
GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES OF EDUCATION INDICATE THAT THE
INTERNATIONALISM OF THE FIELD IS INCLINED TO BE SUPERFICIAL.
