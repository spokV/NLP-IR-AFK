VIDEO IN SWEDEN (1).
     
DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF VIDEO IN SWEDEN AND COMMENTS ON A REPORT BY A
WORKING GROUP OF THE SWEDISH AUTHORS' UNION' 2VIDEO-FOR BETTER AND FOR WORSE1.
THE REPORT WARNS AGAINST THE NEGATIVE SIDES OF THE DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS
DOMINANCE BY COMMERCIAL PRODUCERS AND PASSIVITY AMONG VIEWERS, BUT ALSO POINTS
TO ADVANTAGES, SUCH AS FREEDOM OF CHOICE AND PRODUCTION FOR MINORITIES. BUT
FOR THE POSITIVE SIDES TO BE DEVELOPED, STATE SUPPORT FOR PRODUCTION AND
DISTRIBUTION IS NECESSARY. THUS THE REPORT SUGGESTS FREE LOANS THROUGH PUBLIC
LIBRARIES WITH STATE AID FOR EXTRA STAFF EMPLOYED, FINANCED POSSIBLY THROUGH
VARIOUS TAXES. SOME FORM OF EXPANSION OF FILM CENSORSHIP TO COVER VIDEO IS
NECESSARY. A GOVERNMENT REPORT ON VIDEO ADVERTISING SUGGESTS THAT IT BE
BANNED, IN THE SAME WAY AS TV ADVERTISING. FOR PART 2, 2SEE1 THE FOLLOWING
ABSTRACT.
