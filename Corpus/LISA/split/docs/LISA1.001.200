WHAT'S THAT FUNNY NOISE?' VIDEOGAMES IN THE LIBRARY.A

 YEAR AGO, FLESH PUBLIC LIBRARY, PIQUA, OHIO, INTRODUCED AN ELECTRONIC
LEARNING CENTRE TO INTRODUCE THE 25,000-STRONG PREDOMINANTLY RURAL COMMUNITY
TO THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE CENTRE CONTAINS A PUBLIC MICROCOMPUTER, VIDEOTAPE
AND CAMERA SERVICES, AND A VIDEOGAME CONSOLE WITH 17 GAME CARTRIDGES. THE
VIDEOGAMES HAVE ATTRACTED MANY YOUNG IRREGULAR LIBRARY USERS WHO MAY, IN TIME,
EXTEND THEIR ATTENTION TO OTHER LIBRARY FACILITIES. THE COST OF ESTABLISHING
AND MAINTAINING THE VIDEOGAME AREA HAS BEEN REASONABLE AND PROBLEMS OF
DISCIPLINE, NOISE, AND SUPERVISION HAVE BEEN MINIMAL DUE TO CAREFUL PLANNING.
NO CHARGE IS MADE FOR PLAYING THE GAMES.
