INFORMATION TO STUDY THE ESSENTIAL ATTRIBUTES OF A NATIONAL SCIENCE
INFORMATION SYSTEM TO MEET THE NEEDS OF SCIENCE RESEARCH. ITS REPORT IS NOW
PUBLISHED. AMONGST ITS RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THAT THE SYSTEM MUST BE INTEGRATED
AND BASED ON THE IDEA OF HUMAN AND MATERIAL RESOURCE SHARING; AND ITS
FUNCTIONS ARE ENHANCEMENT OF THE COLLECTION CAPABILITIES AND PROVISION OF
PRIMARY INFORMATION, ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM, AND
PROMOTION OF DATA BASE PRODUCTION.
