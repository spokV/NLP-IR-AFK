NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES.
     
A REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES IN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, BASED ON RECENT
LITERATURE, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE LATIN AMERICAN SITUATION, UNDERTAKEN
BY IBICT, THE BRAZILIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION
IN 1979. AFTER AN INTRODUCTORY EXPLANATION OF BASIC TERMINOLOGY, THE SURVEY
GIVES DETAILED ACCOUNTS OF RECENT NATIONAL PROJECTS AND DEVELOPMENTS, AND OF
EXISTING AND PROJECTED INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE NETWORKS IN EUROPE AND LATIN
AMERICA. THE CONCLUSION COMPARES THE SITUATION IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WHERE
GOVERNMENT POLICY IS TO INVEST STRONGLY IN INCREASING EFFICIENCY OF
INFORMATION SERVICES, WITH THAT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHERE INFORMATION
RESOURCES ARE PRECARIOUS AND DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY, WHILE GOVERNMENT
POLICY LACKS DETERMINATION IN DEVELOPING REALISTIC PROGRAMMES.
