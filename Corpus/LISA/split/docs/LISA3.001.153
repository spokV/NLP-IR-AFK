THE CURRENT STAGE OF INTER-DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY COOPERATION.
     
STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION IN THE USSR CAN BE
TRACED OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS. COOPERATION IS OF 3 TYPES' WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK
OF A DEPARTMENT; INVOLVING LIBRARIES FROM SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS BUT ON THE SAME
SITE OR IN THE SAME ECONOMIC FIELD; OR WITHOUT ANY SUCH BOUNDARIES. THE KEY
ELEMENT IS INTEGRATION' THE PLANNED COMBINATION OF RESOURCES FROM DIFFERENT
LIBRARIES TO ENSURE THEIR EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION. THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THE
FORMATION OF A REGIONAL LIBRARY NETWORK. IN THE LONG-TERM, SUCH INTEGRATED
SYSTEMS WILL HAVE AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN SOVIET
LIBRARIANSHIP.
