A MICRODATABASE FOR ONLINE SEARCH TRAINING.
     
A MICROCOMPUTER EMULATION IS BEING DESIGNED TO ENABLE STUDENTS TO PRACTISE
ON-LINE SEARCHING WITHOUT INCURRING HIGH CONNECT COSTS. THE EMULATION WORKS ON
A DATA BASE OF AROUND 100 RECORDS INCLUDING AUTHOR, TITLE, JOURNAL, LANGUAGE,
ABSTRACT AND DESCRIPTOR FIELDS. THE MAIN LOCKHEED DIALOG COMMANDS ARE EMULATED
INCLUDING FULL TEXT SEARCHING AND TRUNCATION AS WELL AS SELECT, COMBINE, TYPE,
ETC. IT IS ALSO INTENDED TO INCLUDE DIAGNOSTICS IN THE PACKAGE, ENABLING THE
SEARCHER TO SOLICIT HELP FROM THE SYSTEM IF IT IS FELT THAT THE SEARCH IS
BECOMING UNSTRUCTURED OR FAILING IN INTENT. THE PROGRAMME WILL ALSO INTERRUPT
THE SEARCH TO ISSUE WARNINGS IF AN ADEQUATE SEARCH STRATEGY DOES NOT APPEAR TO
BE DEVELOPING. AS PART OF THE PACKAGE A SECONDARY PROGRAMME WILL FACILITATE
THE SEMI-AUTOMATIC CREATION OF ADDITIONAL MICRODATA BASES.
