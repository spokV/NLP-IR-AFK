AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF THREE SUBJECT ACCESS SYSTEMS IN MEDICINE' LCSH, MESH,
PRECIS.
     
(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH). EXAMINES THE SEE ALSO REFERENCE
STRUCTURES (SYNDETIC STRUCTURES) OF 3 SUBJECT ACCESS SYSTEMS USED IN
MEDICINE-PRECIS, MESH, AND LCSH. EXPLORES THEIR DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES
IN AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP THE BEST POSSIBLE STRUCTURE USING FEATURES OF ALL 3. 3
VARIABLES WERE EVALUATED-SUBJECT AREA COVERAGE, BROWSEABILITY, AND
FLEXIBILITY. MAPS WERE DEVELOPED FOR THE SUBJECT HEADINGS IN EACH SYSTEM AND
COMPARED WITH MAPS DEVELOPED FROM RECOGNISED 'CLASSIC' TEXTBOOKS; THIS
PROCEDURE READILY IDENTIFIED GAPS IN COVERAGE AND INCONSISTENCIES IN
TERMINOLOGY CONTROL. SUCH MAPS COULD BE CONVERTED TO COMPUTER DISPLAYS TO
IMPROVE PRECISION AND RECALL IN BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE SEARCHING.
