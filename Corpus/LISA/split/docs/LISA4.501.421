FREE ACCESS TO READING' A NEW POLICY OF OPPORTUNITIES.
     
CRITICISES THE PUBLIC LIBRARY POLICY OF DIVIDING CHILDREN'S BOOKS ACCORDING TO
AGE LEVEL AS CONTRARY TO THE READER'S RIGHT TO SELECT MATERIAL APPROPRIATE TO
HIS OWN ABILITIES. DRAWS ON RECENT STUDIES BY BRAZILIAN RESEARCHERS TO
ESTABLISH THAT FLUENCY IN READING IS A SKILL ACQUIRED PROGRESSIVELY AT AN
INDIVIDUAL RATE DETERMINED BOTH BY AN INCREASE IN MECHANICAL FACILITY AND THE
PROCESS OF MATURING. THUS THE READER'S AGE DOES NOT NECESSARILY CORRESPOND TO
HIS READING CAPACITY, AND ARTIFICIAL DIVISIONS IMPOSED BY LIBRARIES
EFFECTIVELY PREVENT ACCESS TO SUITABLE MATERIAL. THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
ADVANTAGES OF PERMITTING FREE CHOICE OF BOOKS ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO
POPULARISING LIBRARIES AND MAXIMISING USE OF THEIR RESOURCES.
