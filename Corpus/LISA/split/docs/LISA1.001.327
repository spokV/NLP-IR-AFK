SERIALS DEPARTMENTS' DOOMED TO EXTINCTION?.

BECAUSE TASKS AND MATERIALS RELATED TO SERIALS PROCESSING AND USE ARE OFTEN
DISPERSED IN A LIBRARY, SERIALS SPECIALISTS MUST DEVELOP PERSONAL INFLUENCE
STRATEGIES AND USE INFORMAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS WHICH CROSS ORGANISATIONAL
BOUNDARIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, SERIALS SPECIALISTS AND
INFORMAL SERIALS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST. IT IS WIDELY
AGREED THAT INFORMAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS EMERGE SPONTANEOUSLY IN
ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH NO FORMALLY CONFERRED AUTHORITY MAY USE
VARIOUS TYPES OF PERSONAL INFLUENCE STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE ORGANISATIONAL
OBJECTIVES. WHILE SERIALS PROCESSING AND PUBLIC SERVICE COULD BE MOST
EFFICIENTLY HANDLED THROUGH A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, INFORMAL COMMUNICATION
SYSTEMS, UTILISED BY SERIALS SPECIALISTS, WILL DEVELOP IF SUCH A DEPARTMENT
DOES NOT EXIST. IN DETERMINING IF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT HAS A PLACE IN A
PARTICULAR LIBRARY ORGANISATION, LIBRARY PLANNERS SHOULD BE CONCERNED A BOUT
NATURAL COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND SHOULD TRY TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN
COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY ACROSS ORGANISATIONAL BARRIERS.
