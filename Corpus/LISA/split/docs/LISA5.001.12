ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES-ASSISTANTS IN LIBRARIES. A
COMPARISON.

THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE CAREER STRUCTURES OF ASSISTANT
LIBRARIANS IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES AND ASSISTANTS IN LIBRARIES IN WEST
GERMANY. THE PROBLEMS ARISE WITH CAREERS TRAINING; THIS DIFFERS FROM 1 FEDERAL
STATE TO THE NEXT, ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT STANDARDISED NOR ARE THE
SYLLABUSES OR FINAL EXAMINATIONS. THE TYPE OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTE PROVIDING
TRAINING ALSO VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE AND MAY BE A LIBRARY COLLEGE, A
TRAINING LIBRARY OR A POLYTECHNIC. THERE IS NO CLEARLY DEFINED CAREER
STRUCTURE FOR ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS OR ASSISTANTS WHICH CAUSES DIFFICULTIES
WITHIN LIBRARIES WHEN ALLOCATING DUTIES AND DIFFICULTIES IN SALARY GRADES. IT
IS NECESSARY TO AIM AT A JOINT CAREERS TRAINING SCHEME FOR BOTH ASSISTANT
LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY ASSISTANTS BUT BEFORE THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED THE ABOVE
MENTIONED PROBLEMS MUST BE SETTLED.
