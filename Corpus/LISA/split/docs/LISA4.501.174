THE STRUGGLE FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES LAW-1975 (IN
HEBREW).
     
WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED, IT WAS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD
FINANCE 75% OF PUBLIC LIBRARY BUDGETS. THE SITUATION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
YEARS HAS BEEN THAT AN EVER-GROWING PERCENTAGE OF THE BUDGET IS COVERED BY
LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THIS HAS NOT ONLY BROUGHT ABOUT A DETERIORATION OF PUBLIC
LIBRARY SERVICES, BUT MAY LEAD TO A SITUATION IN WHICH THE LIBRARIES SECTION
OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE WILL BE UNABLE TO ENFORCE THE HIGH
STANDARDS IT HAS SET, SINCE IT WILL NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO PASS ON TO
LOCAL AUTHORITIES. DOCUMENTS THE ACTIONS AND EFFORTS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE
FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES LAW SINCE ITS FORMATION IN JUNE
78. THESE INCLUDE CORRESPONDENCE AND MEETINGS WITH SENIOR GOVERNMENT AND
PARLIAMENTARY OFFICIALS AND A PUBLIC EFFORT TO ACHIEVE IMPLEMENTATION, THE
HEIGHT OF WHICH WAS A NATIONAL LIBRARIANS' DEMONSTRATION BEFORE THE MINISTRY
OF E DUCATION AND CULTURE IN JERUSALEM IN JAN 80.
