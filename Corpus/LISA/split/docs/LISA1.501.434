A FRAMEWORK FOR COMPUTER NETWORK PLANNING.
     
A FRAMEWORK IS PRESENTED FOR PLANNING A NETWORK FOR A COMPUTER SERVICE
DELIVERY SYSTEM. THIS FRAMEWORK MAKES EXPLICIT A PLANNING MATRIX FOR FACTORING
THE COMPUTER NEEDS OF THE USERS IN MANAGEABLE UNITS AND DEVELOPS THE
PARAMETERS FOR DECIDING ON A SUITABLE NETWORK TO MEET THE POLITICAL AND
ECONOMIC REQUIREMENTS OF MANAGEMENT. THE MATRIX GIVES THE BASIS FOR STUDYING
ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATIONS FOR MERGING THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THE USERS. FOR
STUDYING CONFIGURATIONS BEYOND A STAND-ALONE SYSTEM, THE CONCEPT OF A NODE IS
INTRODUCED, PERMITTING THE CONSIDERATION OF A SET OF 6 CATEGORIES OF
PARAMETERS. VIEWPOINTS OF NETWORK STRUCTURES HAVING VARIOUS DEGREES OF
ORGANISATIONAL COMPLEXITY ARE DEFINED IN TERMS OF THE NODAL PARAMETERS.
