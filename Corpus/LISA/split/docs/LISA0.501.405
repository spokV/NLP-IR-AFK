VIDEOTEX RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT' THE CANADIAN CONTEXT AND CONTRIBUTION.

IDENTIFIES PRESENT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS IN VIDEOTEX SERVICES, INCLUDING
RESEARCH CONCERNED WITH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, ACCESS TO INFORMATION, SOCIAL
AND BEHAVIOURAL IMPLICATIONS, AND METHODOLOGICAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS. THE
CANADIAN TELIDON VIDEOTEX SYSTEM IS GENERALLY PERCEIVED AS A HIGH-QUALITY
ALTERNATIVE TO THE UK SERIAL ALPHA-MOSAIC AND FRENCH PARALLEL ALPHA-MOSAIC
CODING SYSTEMS. INTRINSIC DIFFERENCES IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF TELIDON HAVE
CREATED A QUITE DIFFERENT COMMUNICATION MEDIUM. NEW DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT (BASED UPON A COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL INDEPENDENT OF DISPLAY,
CARRIER, AND CONTENT AND CAPABLE OF RESPONDING TO A VARIABLE SCALE
COST/QUALITY CONTINUUM) PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT SIGNIFICANT TO
BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY.
