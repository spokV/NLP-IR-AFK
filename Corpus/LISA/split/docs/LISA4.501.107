PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND ADULT EDUCATION ASSOCIATIONS IN COOPERATION.
     
THE ADULT EDUCATION MOVEMENT BUILT UP LIBRARIES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH
CENTURY, BUT WHEN THESE WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES, THE
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ORGANISATIONS AND LIBRARIES LARGELY CEASED. CONSCIOUS
OF THIS, OREBRO REGIONAL LIBRARY IN CONJUNCTION WITH 4 PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND 4
ADULT EDUCATION ASSOCIATIONS DREW UP A PROJECT SUPPORTED BY THE CULTURAL
COUNCIL FOR AN EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD OF 1 YEAR, WITH A PART-TIME LIBRARIAN AS
ORGANISER. THE AIM WAS TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH THE LEADERS, EXAMINE THE
ASSOCIATIONS' NEEDS AND HOW THE LIBRARY COULD MEET THEM. DIRECT CONTACT WITH
THE CLASS LEADERS PROVED DIFFICULT AND ADVANCE NOTICE OF BOOKS NEEDED HARD TO
OBTAIN. STUDY VISITS TO THE LIBRARY WERE MADE BY SOME GROUPS, AND SPECIAL AND
BACKGROUND LITERATURE WAS LENT TO THE GROUPS ON LONG LOANS. CONCLUDES THAT THE
LIBRARIES OFTEN LACKED STAFF AND TIME TO TAKE THE NECESSARY INITIATIVES, AND
THAT THE STUDY GROU P LEADER IS THE KEY TO ANY FRUITFUL CONTACT.
