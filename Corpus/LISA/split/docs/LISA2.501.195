INTERIM REPORT WITH MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FOR LIBRARIES.
     
THE LATEST INTERIM REPORT FROM THE NORWEGIAN JUEL COMMITTEE ON LOCAL
GOVERNMENT REFORM, 2NEW FINANCE SYSTEM FOR COUNTY AUTHORITIES1, COULD
SERIOUSLY AFFECT PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IF ITS PROPOSALS ARE IMPLEMENTED, FINANCIAL
ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN STATE, COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE
ABOLISHED, AND STATE SUBSIDIES GIVEN ONLY WHERE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. STATE
SUPPORT OF LIBRARIES AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IS CONSIDERED NEITHER DESIRABLE
NOR NECESSARY. THE STATE LIBRARY OFFICE, IN REPLY, CONSIDERS THE PRESENT STATE
GRANTS VITAL IN OPERATING A SATISFACTORY LIBRARY SERVICE ACCORDING TO THE
LIBRARY ACT. LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE NOT LEGALLY OBLIGED TO ADMINISTER COUNTY
LIBRARIES; WITHOUT STATE SUPPORT, LIBRARIES MIGHT RECEIVE ONLY MINIMAL SUMS,
LEADING AT WORST TO THE CLOSURE OF COUNTY LIBRARY SERVICES IN SOME COUNTIES.
SINCE PUBLIC AND MOBILE LIBRARIES ARE NOWADAYS CLOSELY LINKED TO COUNTY
LIBRARIES, THIS WOULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THE PROVISION OF  AN ADEQUATE NATIONAL
LIBRARY SERVICE.
