THE UNIFORM SYSTEM OF HOME HEALTH AGENCY REPORTING' AN ANALYSIS OF ITS IMPACT
ON HOME HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS.
     
THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTIMATE THE COSTS TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN
THE UNIFORM SYSTEM FOR HOME HEALTH AGENCY REPORTING (USHHAR). THIS STUDY WILL
PROVIDE INFORMATION NEEDED TO REVISE THE DRAFT USHHAR AND THE DATA NECESSARY
FOR CALCULATING THE REPORTING BURDEN WHEN THE SYSTEM IS ULTIMATELY REVISED.
THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE AREAS OF BURDEN WILL BE USEFUL IN REDUCING THE SCOPE
OF THE REPORTING SYSTEM, BY IDENTIFYING WHERE INCOMPATIBILITIES EXIST.
