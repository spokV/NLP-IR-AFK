THE ISRAELI NATIONAL MEDICAL LIBRARY'S NEW MINICOMPUTERIZED ON-LINE INTEGRATED
SYSTEM (MAIMON).
     
AN IN-HOUSE LIBRARY SYSTEM, BASED ON A DEDICATED MINICOMPUTER, HAS BEEN IN
OPERATION IN ISRAEL'S NATIONAL MEDICAL LIBRARY SINCE SUMMER 79. THE INTEGRATED
SYSTEM, CALLED MAIMON, FEATURES ON-LINE ACCESS TO BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND
CIRCULATION RECORDS. IT REPLACES MANUAL CATALOGUING, SEARCHING, LENDING, AND
RESERVATIONS. IT PROVIDES PREVIOUSLY-UNAVAILABLE STATISTICS ON ITEMS IN HEAVY
USE AND DEMAND, ITEMS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE ACTIVE COLLECTION, AND WHO USES
WHAT IN THE LIBRARY. IT IS DESIGNED TO BE USER-FRIENDLY AND TO SAVE USERS'
TIME. IT HAS BEEN VERY FAVOURABLY RECEIVED BY PATRONS AND FREES PROFESSIONAL
STAFF FROM TIME-CONSUMING ROUTINE CLERICAL TASKS. THE SYSTEM IS EVALUATED IN
TERMS OF PERFORMANCE, CONVENIENCE, AND COST.
