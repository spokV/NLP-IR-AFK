TWO NOTABLE EXPERIMENTS IN CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES: CLAMART, FRANCE AND SAO
PAULO, BRAZIL.
     
FOLLOWING A VISIT TO THE CLAMART 'JOY THROUGH BOOKS' PROJECT IN 1979, THE
LIBRARIAN IN CHARGE OF THE SAO PAULO CHILDREN'S LIBRARY NETWORK COMMENTS ON
THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE 2 SCHEMES, BOTH DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR
RESPECTIVE USERS PLACES WHERE CHILDREN CAN LEARN ABOUT THE WORLD AND BECOME
AWARE OF THE VALUE OF BOOKS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE ORGANISATION AND
OPERATION OF THE 2 SCHEMES, WHERE CONVENTIONAL LIBRARY PRACTICES HAVE BEEN
REPLACED BY MORE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES.
