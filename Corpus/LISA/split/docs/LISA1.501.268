DATA PROTECTION FOR ALL.
     
THE MOTIVATION FOR THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA IS EXAMINED. IT IS FOUND TO
BE OF GENUINE HUMAN VALUE. REASONS FOR ITS IMPORTANCE IN DEVELOPING SOCIETIES
ARE SUGGESTED. IN SPITE OF THE LOW FREQUENCY OF ABUSES, REGULATIONS ARE
NECESSARY AND THE FORM THEY SHOULD TAKE IS CONSIDERED. THE DESIRABILITY OF
BASING THEM ON INTERNATIONALLY-ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS RATHER THAN ON NATIONAL
LAWS IS STRESSED, THOUGH THE NEED FOR THE LATTER IS ACCEPTED. THE PRACTICABLE
POSSIBILITY OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT IS CONSIDERED.
