LIBRARY WORK. GIVES A SHORT HISTORICAL REVIEW OF FORMAL QUALIFICATIONS
REQUIRED OF APPLICANTS TO QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS' POSTS IN SWEDISH ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES. SHOWS HOW NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION AND RESEARCH AS WELL AS IN
LIBRARY TECHNIQUES HAVE AFFECTED CONDITIONS OF WORK IN A LIBRARY. NEW TASKS
HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE TRADITIONAL ONES, AND IT IS NECESSARY TO FIND WAYS OF
RECONCILING THE NEW DEVELOPMENT WITH EXISTING LIBRARY EXPERTISE, AND TO FIND A
COMMON DOMINATOR WHICH WILL WORK TOWARDS AN INTEGRATION OF ALL TASKS IN A
LIBRARY. THIS IS FOUND IN THE OVERALL AIMS FOR LIBRARY WORK' TO MEET THE NEEDS
OF THE CUSTOMER. INSTRUCTION AND TRAINING ON HOW BEST TO MEET THE USERS' NEEDS
