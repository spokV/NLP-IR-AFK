THE HANDICAPPED AND LIBRARIES.

THE HANDICAPPED ARE DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR SPREADING KNOWLEDGE OF
AVAILABLE AIDS AND THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES. SOCIETY CREATES THE HANDICAP BY
MAKING ACTIVITIES UNAVAILABLE. IT IS THEREFORE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SOCIETY
AND INDIVIDUALS TO SEE THAT OBSTACLES ARE REMOVED NOT JUST TO BETTER LIVING
CONDITIONS, BUT ALSO TO A FULL CULTURAL LIFE FOR THE HANDICAPPED. THE DEMAND
FOR INFORMATION ON MATERIAL FOR THE HANDICAPPED AVAILABLE IN LIBRARIES WAS
SHOWN IN A CAMPAIGN LED BY KALMAR REGIONAL LIBRARY TO BE GROWING AMONG
TEACHERS TRYING TO INTEGRATE THE HANDICAPPED IN SCHOOLS. STAFF WITHIN THE
SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS CAN ALSO ACT AS LINKS BETWEEN THE HANDICAPPED AND THE
LIBRARY. THE REGIONAL LIBRARY MUST STIMULATE LOCAL LIBRARIES TO INITIATE
DOMICILIARY SERVICES AND ESTABLISH SYSTEMS FOR LENDING OF SPEAKING BOOKS AND
PERSONAL CONTACTS WITH USERS. THE MASS MEDIA AND SPECIAL TEACHERS ARE OTHER
MEANS OF REACHING THE HANDICAPPED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT LIBRARY SERVI CES.
