LESSING'S LIBRARY POST IN WOLFENBUTTEL. PART I.

GOTTHOLD EPHRAIM LESSING WAS LIBRARIAN AT THE COURT OF BRUNSWICK AND LUNEBERG
IN THE 1770S. SOME OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT WRITINGS WERE PRODUCED DURING THIS
PERIOD BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE THOUGHT THAT THE POST WAS A SINECURE HELD TO
ENABLE HIM TO WRITE. THERE IS PROOF IN HIS OWN WORKS THAT HE TOOK
LIBRARIANSHIP SERIOUSLY. THE OPINIONS OF VARIOUS CONTEMPORARY AND MODERN
WRITERS ON LESSING'S LIBRARY WORK ARE ANALYSED. MANY OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES
THOUGHT HIM DISORGANISED BUT HIS CATALOGUE OF NEW LIBRARY STOCKS, AMOUNTING TO
ABOUT 100,000 VOLUMES, REMAINED UNFINISHED BECAUSE OF STAFF SHORTAGES AND
ULTIMATELY BECAUSE OF HIS OWN DEATH. SOME PEOPLE REGARD HIM AS THE THEORETICAL
FOUNDER OF MODERN LENDING LIBRARIES.
