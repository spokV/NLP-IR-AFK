TERMINOLOGY OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES: THE TERM 'COGNITIVE PROCESSES' IN THE
THESAURI OF TWO DISCIPLINE-BASED INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
     
(PHD THESIS-CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY, OHIO). HIERARCHICAL CHARTS
SHOWING THE ARRAYS UNDER THE TERM 'COGNITIVE PROCESSES' IN THE ERIC THESAURUS
AND THESAURUS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL INDEX TERMS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE TERM APPEARS
IN DIFFERENT HIERARCHIES IN THE 2 INDEXING LANGUAGES. 3 EXPLANATIONS ARE
OFFERED, DISCUSSED, AND REJECTED. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THE NEED FOR FURTHER
SIMILAR STUDIES.
