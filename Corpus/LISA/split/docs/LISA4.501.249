INFORMATION SERVICES TO TRADE, INDUSTRY AND THE PROFESSIONS.
     
THE LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARY, SUCH AS THE JOHANNESBURG PUBLIC LIBRARY, SOUTH
AFRICA, THAT IS SITUATED IN AN AREA WITH MANY SPECIAL LIBRARIES, CAN PROVIDE
AN INFORMATION SERVICE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO ARE WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE
SPECIAL LIBRARIES. SUCH A LIBRARY CAN OFTEN PROVIDE REFERENCE MATERIAL WHICH
IS NOT SPECIALISED ENOUGH FOR THE SPECIAL LIBRARY WHILE NOT POPULAR ENOUGH FOR
THE SMALLER PUBLIC LIBRARY. AT LEAST SOME INFORMATION SOURCES ON A VERY WIDE
RANGE OF SUBJECTS ARE REQUIRED. THE LIBRARY STAFF CANNOT BE EXPERTS ON ALL
THESE FIELDS. THEY CONSEQUENTLY REFER USERS TO INFORMATION SOURCES AND EXPECT
USERS TO DO THEIR OWN SEARCHING. USERS OFTEN FALL IN THE SMALL BUSINESS
CATEGORY AND ARE WITHOUT LIBRARIES OF THEIR OWN. THE INFORMATION THEY NEED MAY
SOMETIMES NOT BE AVAILABLE IN A FORM APPLICABLE TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN
SITUATION. THE JOHANNESBURG PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVES AS A DEPOSITORY FOR THE
JOURNALS RECEIVED BY MANY SCIENTIFIC A ND TECHNICAL SOCIETIES IN JOHANNESBURG,
AND IN SOME CASES THE LIBRARY MANAGES AND MAINTAINS THE LIBRARY OF A SOCIETY
WITHIN THE JPL BUILDING. RENDERING INFORMATION SERVICES IS ONE WAY TO SHOW
THAT THE LIBRARY IS USING PUBLIC MONEY TO GOOD ADVANTAGE.
