BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL OF MICROFORMS' SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVED LOCAL ACCESS.
     
PROVIDING COMPLETE ANALYTICS FOR MICROFORM COLLECTIONS IS MORE THE IDEAL
RATHER THAN THE REALITY FOR MOST LIBRARIES. EVEN WITH PARTIALLY ANALYSED
COLLECTIONS, HOWEVER, LIBRARIES CAN IMPROVE ACCESS AND PUBLICISE THE EXTENT OF
THEIR HOLDINGS THROUGH A NUMBER OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC AIDS. THESE AIDS INCLUDE
LABELLING MICROFORM BIBLIOGRAPHIES, PLACING PLASTIC OVERLAYS ON CATALOGUE
CARDS, ANNOTATING SHORT TITLE CATALOGUES, AND COMPILING GUIDEBOOKS TO MAJOR
MICROFORM COLLECTIONS.
