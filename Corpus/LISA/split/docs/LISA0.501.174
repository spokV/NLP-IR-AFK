RESOURCES OF LIBRARY CENTRALISATION; AN EDITORIAL 'ROUND TABLE'. THE MAIN WORK
LIES AHEAD.

CENTRALISATION HAS FREED LIBRARIANS FROM MANY ROUTINE TASKS, MAKING THEIR WORK
MORE CREATIVE. LIBRARIES' TRANSFORMATION INTO SOCIAL AND LEISURE CENTRES HAS
COMPELLED LIBRARIANS TO EXTEND THE SUBJECT RANGE OF WORK WITH THE PUBLIC.
CENTRALISATION'S PROBLEMS INCLUDE' UNSATISFIED BOOK REQUESTS; UTILISATION OF
UNIFIED BOOKSTOCK; NEED FOR LIBRARY MECHANISATION AND FOR STAFF WITH
SPECIALISED LIBRARY EDUCATION; INTERLIBRARY LOANS. THE BOOKTRADE HAS SHIRKED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR BUILDING UP LIBRARY STOCKS; 85% OF LIBRARY FICTION AND 90%
OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE REQUIREMENTS REMAIN UNFULFILLED. THE 11TH 5-YEAR-PLAN
MUST INVOLVE' (1) INTENSIFYING LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT AND INCREASED
EFFECTIVENESS; (2) MAXIMUM SATISFACTION OF BOOK-REQUESTS; (3) ENHANCING
LIBRARIES' SOCIAL ROLE; (4) TRAINING LIBRARY STAFF FOR A CREATIVE
WORK-RELATIONSHIP; (5) LEARNED LIBRARIES' AND BOOKSELLERS' PARTICIPATION TO
IMPROVE CENTRALISATIO N.
