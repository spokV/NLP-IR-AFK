LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANSHIP IN CANADA.
     
PRESENTS A PICTURE OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN CANADA. THE SUB-SECTIONS ARE
GEOGRAPHIC AND TOPICAL BUT ALL EMPHASISE THE CURRENT SITUATION. THE SPARSE
POPULATION, THE VASTNESS OF THE COUNTRY, THE POLITICAL ORGANISATION, THE
MULTICULTURAL AND MULTILINGUAL NATURE OF THE INHABITANTS HAVE ALL INFLUENCED
LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANSHIP IN CANADA. UP TO RECENTLY THE LIBRARY SITUATION
WAS BUOYANT BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE PRESENT AND THE NEAR FUTURE ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS WILL SLOW THE PROCESS AND WILL FORCE A REASSESSMENT OF THE ROLE OF
LIBRARIES IN CANADIAN SOCIETY.
