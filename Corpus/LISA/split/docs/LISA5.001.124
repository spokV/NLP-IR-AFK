THE LIBRARY UNION IN HAMBURG.

IN 1978 A COOPERATIVE SCHEME WAS INAUGURATED BETWEEN THE COMBINED STATE AND
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND OVER 100 INSTITUTE AND DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES OF THE
COLLEGES OF TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE A UNION CATALOGUE AND ORGANISE COOPERATIVE
PURCHASING OF BOOKS AND PERIODICALS. THE SCHEME HAS ALSO BEEN JOINED BY THE
TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY AT HAMBURG-HARBURG AND WILL ULTIMATELY INCLUDE OTHER
LIBRARIES IN NORTH GERMANY. WORK ON THE UNION CATALOGUE HAS BEGUN WITH THE
UNIVERSITY'S PERIODICALS, FOR WHICH ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING IS USED.
CHANGES IN THE DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM WILL SHORTLY BE MADE AND MORE WORK IS
NEEDED ON HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. MORE SPACE AND MONEY WILL BE NEEDED AS THE
SCHEME EXPANDS.
