THE NEED FOR PROFESSIONAL AND IDEO-POLITICAL AWARENESS.
     
ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES (SCHOOL, PUBLIC AND TRADE UNION) HAVE TO IMPART THE
IDEAS OF THE 12TH COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS TO THE ENTIRE BULGARIAN NATION. THE
COMMUNIST CONGRESS OUTLINED ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL POLICIES WHICH HAVE
TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY WORKERS IN INDUSTRY AND IN AGRICULTURE ACTING IN A
DISCIPLINED AND RESPONSIBLE WAY. LIBRARIANS MUST USE A SYSTEMATIC AND PERSONAL
APPROACH AND DEAL WITH THE CLASS STRUGGLE, THE ROLE OF THE USSR IN THE WORLD,
THE GENERAL INTERNATIONAL SITUATION AND MANY OTHER TOPICS ON ALL THE REQUIRED
LEVELS. LIBRARIANS SHOULD DISPLAY RELEVANT LITERATURE, ARRANGE EXHIBITIONS AND
DISCUSSION MEETINGS, AND COMPILE RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHIES. THESE ARE ONLY A
FEW SUGGESTIONS WHICH MUST BE IMPLEMENTED TO REACH THE SET GOALS.
