LIBRARY SERVICES TO THE DISADVANTAGED: NOT QUITE WHAT THEY SEEM.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE UK PUBLIC LIBRARIES GROUP WEEKEND SCHOOL, BATH 1980.
DISCUSSES THE STANDARD OF THE PROVISION MADE BY UK PUBLIC LIBRARIES FOR THE
DISADVANTAGED, AND ARGUES THAT, WHILST LIBRARIES HAVE LARGELY RESPONDED TO THE
NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTIONALLY DISADVANTAGED (EG HOSPITAL PATIENTS, THE
HANDICAPPED, AND PRISON INMATES), THE SOCIALLY AND CULTURALLY DISADVANTAGED
HAVE BEEN LARGELY IGNORED. IDENTIFIES A BASIC DICHOTOMY WHICH HAS 2 ASPECTS:
THE DISPARITY BETWEEN LEVELS OF PROVISION FOR VARIOUS DISADVANTAGED GROUPS;
AND THE DISPARITY BETWEEN SERVICE TO THE DISADVANTAGED AND SERVICE TO THE
COMMUNITY AT LARGE. REPORTS CRITICISMS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE OF THE INADEQUACY
OF THE WORK DONE BY LIBRARIES WITH ETHNIC MINORITIES, IN DEPRIVED AREAS, AND
WITH RELATION TO FUNCTIONAL LITERACY AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF READING.
STRESSES THE NEED FOR THE PROVISION OF COURSES ON, AND THE INITIATION OF
RESEARCH INTO, LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISADVANTAGED.
