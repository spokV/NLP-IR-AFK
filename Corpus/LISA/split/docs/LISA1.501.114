THE SHARE OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE BASED ON MARXISM INCREASED RAPIDLY. THE CYRIL
AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY HAS THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF FOREIGN ECONOMIC
LITERATURE IN THE COUNTRY CONSISTING MAINLY OF REFERENCE MATERIAL. THE MAIN
TOPIC AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOFIA LIBRARY IS ECONOMIC HISTORY AND SOME UNIQUE
PUBLICATIONS CAN BE FOUND THERE, FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE EARLY DAYS OF THE SOVIET

AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY, ESTABLISHED SOME TIME AG O. THE MAJORITY OF FOREIGN
ECONOMIC LITERATURE IS IN RUSSIAN, ENGLISH, GERMAN AND FRENCH. ADVOCATES THE
INCREASED EXPLOITATION OF ALL THE NATIONAL RESOURCES LISTED ABOVE.
