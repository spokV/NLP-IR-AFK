STAFFING FOR READER SERVICES IN POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION). 5 UK POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES (AT MANCHESTER, OXFORD,
HATFIELD, TRENT, AND COVENTRY (LANCHESTER)) WERE SURVEYED WITH SPECIAL
REFERENCE TO THE INFLUENCE OF MULTI-SITE OPERATION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF
READER SERVICES. THE LIBRARIES PLACED MUCH EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF SUBJECT
SPECIALISTS IN MAINTAINING GOOD USER RELATIONS. ALL FOUND IT EASIER TO BUILD
UP SUCH RELATIONS IN SMALLSITE RATHER THAN LARGE CENTRAL LIBRARIES. OPINIONS
AND POLICIES CONCERNING SUBJECT SPECIALIST DUTIES VARIED. ALTERNATIVES TO
SUBJECT SPECIALIST SYSTEMS WERE NOT FAVOURED. FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS WERE
HAVING A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE EFFORTS OF POLYTECHNICS TO CONCENTRATE THEIR
WORK ON 1 CAMPUS.
