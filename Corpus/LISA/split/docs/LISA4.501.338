COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SOVIET SERIAL EXCHANGES.
     
WHILE THE TRADITIONAL VIEW HAS BEEN THAT SOVIET PUBLICATIONS WERE BEST
ACQUIRED THROUGH EXCHANGES, A RECENT REVIEW OF SOVIET SERIALS AT DUKE
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SUGGESTS THAT THIS MAY NO LONGER BE AS TRUE AS IT ONCE WAS.
THE AVAILABILITY OF SOVIET PUBLICATIONS THROUGH NORMAL TRADE CHANNELS HAS
INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS. BECAUSE OF THIS FACT, THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING
EQUITABLE EXCHANGES IN ECONOMIC TERMS HAS INCREASED. OUR EXAMINATION HAS SHOWN
THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED THAT SUCH EXCHANGES ARE EQUITABLE. REGULAR
REVIEWS ARE RECOMMENDED TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF LIBRARIES BEST.
