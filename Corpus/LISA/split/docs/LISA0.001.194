THE SCHEDULING OF WORK.

NOTES THE INCREASING FREQUENCY OF SHIFT WORK, 4-DAY WORKING WEEKS, AND
FLEXIBLE WORKING HOURS IN US ORGANISATIONS. DISCUSSES EACH OF THESE VARIATIONS
IN THE TRADITIONAL WORKING WEEK, AND EXAMINES THEIR ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES. SUGGESTS WAYS IN WHICH ORGANISATIONS SHOULD APPROACH A CHANGE
IN THEIR WORK SCHEDULE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO EASE ITS ACCEPTANCE, AND ENSURE THAT
THE CONTEMPLATED CHANGE IS RIGHT FOR THEM AND THEIR EMPLOYEES.
