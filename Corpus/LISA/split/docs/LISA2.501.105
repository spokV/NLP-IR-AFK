ADAPTING AND ADDRESSING EDUCATIONAL GOALS IN THE LIBRARY AT THE AUSTINE SCHOOL.
     
SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND MEDIA CENTRES VARY WIDELY IN SIZE, QUALITY OF SERVICE,

ILLUSTRATE HOW THIS IS DONE AT THE AUSTINE SCHOOL FOR HEARING HANDICAPPED
CHILDREN, AND TO DRAW GENERAL CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HOW A SCHOOL'S LIBRARY CAN BE
SURE OF SATISFYING SPECIALISED NEEDS IN HARMONY WITH ITS ACADEMIC PROGRAMME.
