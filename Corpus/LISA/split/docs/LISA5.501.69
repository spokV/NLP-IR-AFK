PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA 1979-80.

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA, INCLUDING THOSE RUN BY THE
LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THOSE RUN BY THE CHURCHES, IS 2,343. 94.8% OF TOWNS AND
VILLAGES LARGE ENOUGH TO HAVE THEIR OWN BRANCH LIBRARIES DO HAVE THEM. 46% OF
LIBRARIES STOCK UNDER 3,000 ITEMS, ONLY 4% STOCK OVER 30,000. IN 1980 22.5
MILLION LOANS WERE MADE TO OVER 1 MILLION READERS AND TOTAL EXPENDITURE
AMOUNTED TO 97.1 MILLION DM. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME
HAS SHOWN POSITIVE RESULTS. NEW BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED, OLD ONES
EXTENDED AND IMPROVED. THERE ARE MORE QUALIFIED STAFF EMPLOYED AND BETTER
STAFF TRAINING PROGRAMMES THAN BEFORE. AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA, PUBLICITY WORK AND
THE REGIONAL INTER-LOAN SYSTEM HAVE BECOME MORE PROMINENT. MORE REFERENCE
WORKS ARE STILL NEEDED AND MORE LITERATURE FOR FOREIGN CHILDREN.
