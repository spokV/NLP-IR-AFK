THE DRUG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHEMICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM OF NCI'S
DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM.
     
THE US NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE'S DRUG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHEMICAL
INFORMATION SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED TO MONITOR THE ACCESSION, STORAGE, AND
DISTRIBUTION OF CHEMICALS AND DRUGS FOR ANTI-TUMOUR TESTING. IT IDENTIFIES
DUPLICATES AND ANALOGUES OF INTEREST TO THE INSTITUTE'S DEVELOPMENTAL
THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM; PRODUCES ACTION AND INFORMATION DOCUMENTS AS REQUIRED;
MAINTAINS INVENTORY CONTROL; AND INTERFACES WITH THE BIOLOGY DATA PROCESSING
SYSTEM WHICH EVALUATES AND DISSEMINATES SCREENING RESULTS. AN ON-LINE
INTERACTIVE RETRIEVAL SUBSYSTEM PERMITS SUBSTRUCTURE AND FULL STRUCTURE
SEARCHING ON A FILE OF 310,000 COMPOUNDS. RESULTS OF SEARCHING OTHER DATA
BASES ARE LINKED WITH THE SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY COMPOUNDS WORTHY OF ACQUISITION.
AN INDEX OF NON-SYSTEMATIC NAMES IN 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1, REFERENCED TO
COMPOUNDS IN THE SYSTEM, IS GENERATED.
