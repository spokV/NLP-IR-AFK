A PLANNED DECENTRALIZED SOLUTION FOR NATIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY' THE FEDERAL
REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.
     
EDITED VERSION OF PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON NATIONAL
DOCUMENT PROVISION, BOSTON SPA, 22-24 SEPT 80. SUPRAREGIONAL DOCUMENT SUPPLY
IS DECENTRALISED IN WEST GERMANY BECAUSE THE POLITICAL FRAMEWORK IS FEDERAL.
COORDINATION OF ACQUISITIONS IS ACHIEVED BY THE DEUTSCHE
FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT, WHICH ORGANISES AND LARGELY FUNDS A COOPERATIVE
PROGRAMME BASED ON SPECIAL SUBJECT LIBRARIES
(SONDERSAMMELGEBIETSBIBLIOTHEKEN). THE 7 REGIONAL UNION CATALOGUES HAVE BEEN
SUPPLEMENTED BY CENTRAL SUBJECT CATALOGUES, THE BERLIN PERIODICALS DATA BASE,
AND OTHER UNION CATALOGUING PROJECTS. INTERLENDING IS BASED ON THE 7 REGIONS,
BUT DIRECT REQUESTING TO THE SPECIAL SUBJECT LIBRARIES HAS INCREASED
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE SEARCH FOR FASTER SUPPLY TIMES.
