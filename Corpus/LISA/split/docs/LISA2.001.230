DIRECTORY OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION SERVICES AND SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES.
     
DEVELOPING NATIONS HAVE COME TO RECOGNISE THAT INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL
INFORMATION IS A KEY ELEMENT IN ACCELERATING THE PROCESS OF INDUSTRIALISATION.
IN RECENT YEARS, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL
INFORMATION CENTRES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE TYPES
OF SERVICES THEY PERFORM AND THE SUBJECTS ON WHICH THEY PROVIDE INFORMATION
ARE VARIED. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT DIRECTORY IS TO MAKE MORE WIDELY KNOWN AND
TO PROMOTE THE FULL USE OF EXISTING INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION
FACILITES IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
