WHAT CAN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY DO TO INCREASE LITERACY?.
     
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IS TRADITIONALLY REGARDED AS A RESOURCE FOR CULTURALLY
ADVANCED AND LITERATE PEOPLE. SOUTH AFRICA HAS BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING
COMMUNITIES. WHILE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY USUALLY FOCUSES ON THE NEEDS OF
ESTABLISHED READERS, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL CASE FOR PROVIDING INNOVATIVE
FORMS OF SERVICE TO ILLITERATE AND NEO-LITERATE COMMUNITIES, AND FOR ACTUALLY
PROMOTING LITERACY THROUGH THE LIBRARY. THE CONCEPT OF LITERACY IS DISCUSSED
IN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING SECTORS, AND LITERACY IS PLACED IN
ITS CULTURAL CONTEXT. THE PROBLEMS OF SEMI-ILLITERACY AMONG EDUCATED PEOPLE
ARE SEEN AS PART OF THE SPECTRUM OF ILLITERACY, WHICH EXTENDS FROM FORMALLY
EDUCATED PEOPLE WITH POOR READING ABILITY TO UNEDUCATED RURAL DWELLERS. THE
ROLE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY WITH REGARD TO LITERACY ACROSS THE SPECTRUM IS
DISCUSSED, WITH SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS GIVEN FOR TASKS WHICH THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
CAN UNDERTAKE TO PROMOTE LITERACY.
