PAPER PRESENTED AT THE ASLIB TECHNICAL TRANSLATION GROUP CONFERENCE, LONDON 20
NOV 80. DESCRIBES A MODEL LINGUISTIC DATA BANK (LDB) FOR A UK MARKET, BASED ON
RESULTS FROM A CONTINUING FEASIBILITY STUDY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER
INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. A LDB REPRESENTS AN ECONOMICAL AND HIGHLY
EFFICIENT WAY OF ORGANISING THE UK'S EFFORTS IN THE FIELD OF TERMINOLOGY, BOTH
WITH RESPECT TO ENGLISH AND THE MANY FOREIGN LANGUAGES THROUGH WHICH CONTACT
IS MAINTAINED WITH NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES. OUTLINES THE INSTITUTIONAL
AND ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND EMPHASISES THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO
VARIOUS GROUPS, AND IN PARTICULAR TO TRANSLATORS, AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE THESE
GROUPS WILL PLAY IN ASSURING THE CONTINUING VIABILITY AND RELEVANCE OF THE
LDB, NOT ONLY AS USERS, BUT AS CONTRIBUTORS AND ADVISORS. CONSIDERS DATA
ACQUISITION POLICY AND FINANCIAL ASPECT.
