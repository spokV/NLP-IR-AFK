THE SUBJECT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE.

THE EXISTING DEFINITIONS OF 'THE SUBJECT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE' ARE REVIEWED AND
SEVERAL SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES TO THE DEFINITION OF THE SUBJECT OF A SCIENTIFIC
DISCIPLINE ARE DISCUSSED. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE SUBJECT OF LIBRARY SCIENCES
CAN BE DESCRIBED AS 'THE LAWS GOVERNING THE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH AND
RELATED TO THE USE OF BOOKS', AND THE SUBJECT OF SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP AS 'THE
LAWS GOVERNING THE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH AND RELATED TO THE USE OF BOOKS
IN SPECIAL LIBRARIES'. BELIEVES THAT 'SPECIAL LIBRARIANSHIP' IS NOT AN
INDEPENDENT DISCIPLINE AND ARGUES THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE DISCIPLINE CALLED
'LIBRARY SCIENCE' AND THAT THE THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES OF SOVIET LIBRARIANSHIP
APPLY TO ALL LIBRARIES.
