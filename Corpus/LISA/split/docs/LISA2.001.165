THE STRUCTURE OF ROMAN CATHOLIC LIBRARY WORK (III AND IV).
     
MOST WEST GERMANY DIOCESES HAVE A LIBRARY CENTRE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL ROMAN
CATHOLIC PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITHIN THE DIOCESE. LIBRARY CENTRES WERE DEVELOPED
AFTER WORLD WAR 2 FROM THE BORROMEUS ASSOCIATION'S DIOCESAN CENTRES. A LIBRARY
CENTRE'S TASKS INCLUDE' PROVIDING ADVICE AND PRACTICAL HELP FOR LIBRARY
DEVELOPMENT; PROVIDING HELP WITH TECHNICAL PROBLEMS; ORGANISING BASIC AND
ADVANCED TRAINING FOR PROFESSIONAL AND NON-PROFESSIONAL STAFF; ADMINISTERING
CHURCH AND PUBLIC FUNDS FOR THE LIBRARIES; REPRESENTING CHURCH LIBRARY
INTERESTS WITHIN RELIGIOUS AND PUBLIC SPHERES; PROVIDING THEOLOGICAL MATERIAL
AND ESTABLISHING THE LIBRARY'S ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY. A STATE WORKING PARTY
ORGANISES THE COOPERATION OF ALL LIBRARY CENTRES WITHIN A FEDERAL STATE,
ACTING AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE BODY AND AS A FORUM FOR THE EXCHANGE OF
EXPERIENCE. FOR PARTS 1 AND 2, 2SEE1 80/3571 AND 81/289 RESPECTIVELY.
