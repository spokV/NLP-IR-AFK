LOANS IN THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION SERVICES TO SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY, HELD
23-24 APR 79. INTERLIBRARY LENDING SYSTEM IN FINLAND COMPRISES A NETWORK OF
RESEARCH LIBRARIES AS WELL AS SOME 50% OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES. REGIONAL LIBRARIES
HAVE THE ROLE OF INTERLENDING CENTRES; THE HELSINKI CITY LIBRARY HAS THE
FUNCTION OF THE NATIONAL CENTRE. ORGANISATION OF THE SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED.
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NOT, SO FAR, ANY FIXED PROCEDURES THE REGIONAL CENTRES ACT
AS INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THE RESEARCH LIBRARIES. IN ITS ROLE
OF THE FINNISH BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CENTRE THE HELSINKI UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
PUBLISHES THE UNION CATALOGUE OF FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS. THE LIBRARY HAS THE
FULLEST COLLECTION, OUTSIDE THE USSR, OF RUSSIAN 1820-1917 IMPRINTS DUE TO ITS
LEGAL DEPOSIT RIGHTS TO RUSSIAN PUBLICATIONS IN THIS PERIOD. STATISTICS ARE
GIVEN OF LOANS FROM THIS COLLECTION.
