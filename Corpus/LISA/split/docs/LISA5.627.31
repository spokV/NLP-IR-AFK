THE 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF TOY LIBRARIES IN STOCKHOLM 1981 INCLUDED
PAPERS, LECTURES, WORKSHOPS, AN EXTENSIVE TOY EXHIBITION, AND VISITS TO
HOSPITALS, DAY NURSERIES, CLINICS, PRESCHOOLS AND TOY LIBRARIES. APART FROM
LOANING TOYS, A TOY LIBRARY AIMS TO ADVISE AND STIMULATE THROUGH PLAY,
PARTICULARLY TO DEPRIVED FAMILIES. VISITS (IN SWEDEN) ARE BY APPOINTMENT AND
DOCTOR'S REFERRAL. TOYS ARE SELECTED ACCORDING TO THE CHILD'S CURRENT NEEDS.
SIBLINGS ARE INVOLVED. COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY SUPPORTING TOY LIBRARIES INCLUDE
DENMARK, SWEDEN, THE NETHERLANDS, ICELAND, UK AND ITALY. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE
RARELY INVOLVED.
