INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY: SUBSTITUTE OR SUPPORT FOR THE HUMAN
COMPONENTS?.

DISCUSSION ABOUT OR APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY IS HINDERED BY PEOPLE'S
ATTITUDES TO IT, RANGING FROM THE OVER-ENTHUSIASTIC TO THE PROFOUNDLY
SUSPICIOUS. MEN SEEM TO HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY COMPUTERS, SO THE HUMAN FACTOR
IN TECHNOLOGY IS NEGLECTED. DATA BASES MUST, HOWEVER, BE ORIENTED TOWARDS
MAN'S NEEDS, AND DIALOGUE SYSTEMS ARE MEANT FOR MACHINES AND MEN; HUMAN
INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN MACHINES AND USERS WILL BE NEEDED FOR A LONG TIME. ALL
SCIENTISTS SEARCH THEIR OWN STOCK OF INFORMATION BEFORE USING OTHER SOURCES;
AT PRESENT THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN OR ANALYSIS OF THESE SMALL, INFORMAL
STOCKS. CONNECTION OF LARGE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WITH INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION
SYSTEMS WOULD SHOW RESPECT FOR THE HUMAN COMPONENTS. THE INFORMAL HUMAN
EXCHANGE OF OPINION AND THE HUMAN BRAIN'S ABILITY TO CREATE CROSS-CONNECTIONS
IN INFORMATION ARE STILL ESSENTIAL.
