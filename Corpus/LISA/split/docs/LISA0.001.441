PLIDOS-AN EXAMPLE OF THE USE OF MICROCOMPUTERS IN INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION.

PLIDOS IS A COMPLETE SOFTWARE SYSTEM FOR THE CREATION AND OPERATION OF
MINIATURE DATA BANKS WITH A MICROCOMPUTER, CONTAINING PROGRAMMES FOR DATA
RECORDING, DATA BANK CONSTRUCTION AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. A PROTOTYPE WAS
TESTED AT THE HANOVER TRADES FAIR IN 1980 AND THE TEST REVEALED A NEED FOR A
SYSTEM OF THIS TYPE. THE MANUFACTURERS PLAN TO OFFER ALSO A PLIDOS DATA BANK
SERVICE FROM 1981. PLIDOS CANNOT COMPETE WITH EXPENSIVE DATA PROCESSING
SYSTEMS FOR LARGE COMPUTERS BUT IT DOES OFFER USERS A CHANCE TO OPERATE THEIR
OWN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM WITHOUT RUNNING COSTS FOR COMPUTING
TIME OR DATA TRANSMISSION. THE CATEGORY SCHEME IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO SATISFY
USERS' SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. THE SEARCH LOGIC INCLUDES FUNCTIONS AND AND OR
AND TRUNCATED SEARCH TERMS CAN BE USED.
