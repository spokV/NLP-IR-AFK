PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT IN CHILDREN'S SERVICES.

PREPARED FROM THE AUTHOR'S NOTES FOR A TALK AT THE ONTARIO LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
CONFERENCE, OCT 80. IDENTIFIES SOME ASPECTS OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT WHICH ARE
SPECIAL TO CHILDREN'S PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO
SUCCESSFULLY MAINTAIN THE MIDDLE MANAGEMENT ROLE, BEING FAMILIAR WITH TOP
MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS DESPITE THE TRADITIONAL PHYSICAL AND FUNCTIONAL
ISOLATION OF THE CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT. SMOOTH RUNNING OF THE DEPARTMENT IS
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS THE CLIENTS' EMOTIONAL DEMANDS ON STAFF ARE SO
GREAT. THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN MUST ESTABLISH HIS PLACE IN THE LIBRARY'S
MIDDLE MANAGEMENT TEAM AND TACTFULLY ENSURE THAT HIS DEPARTMENT, TOO, HAS A
FULL COMPLEMENT OF PROFESSIONALLY-QUALIFIED STAFF.
