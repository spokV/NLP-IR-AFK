THE ORGANISATION AND METHODS OF PLANNING RESEARCH WORK IN THE M.E.
SALTYKOV-SHCHEDRIN STATE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
ADEQUATE PLANNING IS A NECESSARY PRE-REQUISITE OF ALL RESEARCH WORK. PLANNING
FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH FOLLOWS THE SAME GUIDELINES AS OTHER GOVERNMENT PLANNING,
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT POLITICAL COMMITMENT, RELEVANCE, CONTINUITY AND
PURPOSIVENESS. 1ST, A LIST OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS OVER THE NEXT 20
YEARS IS DRAWN UP; THEN A 5-YEAR PLAN IS WORKED OUT TO CONCENTRATE ON THE MOST
IMMEDIATE OF THESE PROBLEMS; THEN A YEARLY PLAN IS DRAWN UP TO IMPLEMENT THE
5-YEAR PLAN. EXAMPLES OF SUCH A PROGRAMME IN OPERATION CAN BE SEEN IN THE
RESEARCH WORK OF THE SALTYKOV-SHCHEDRIN STATE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
