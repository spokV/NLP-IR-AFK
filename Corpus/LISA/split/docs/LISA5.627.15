BRADFORD'S LAW OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC SCATTER.

ANALYSES THE AMBIGUITY INHERENT IN BRADFORD'S LAW, AND ATTRIBUTES THIS TO THE
INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE VERBAL AND GRAPHICAL FORMS OF ITS EXPRESSION.
DEMONSTRATES HOW BRADFORD'S LAW CAN BE REWRITTEN SO THAT THEORY AND EMPIRICAL
RESULTS WILL CORRESPOND EXACTLY. TO EXTEND THE PRACTICAL USE OF SUCH A
MATHEMATICAL MODEL, INTRODUCES THE CONCEPTS OF NORMAL SITUATION AND
NORMALISATION OF RESEARCH, AND USES ZIPF'S 2ND LAW TO ESTABLISH A MODEL VALID
FOR NORMAL SITUATIONS BUT WITH WIDER APPLICATION AND GREATER OBJECTIVITY THAN
BRADFORD'S.
