WAS OPENED IN LEIPZIG IN 1894, THE 1ST LIBRARY OF ITS KIND IN GERMANY. CURRENT
STOCKS OF BRAILLE WORKS TOTAL 7,700, COMPRISING 26,700 VOLUMES, SINCE WORKS IN

AND NON-FICTION FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND LITERATURE IS ALSO PROVIDED ON
TAPES (67,000), CASSETTES (25,000) AND RECORDS. SOUND RECORDINGS ARE
PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR THE ELDERLY, WHO FIND IT HARD TO LEARN BRAILLE. MOST
