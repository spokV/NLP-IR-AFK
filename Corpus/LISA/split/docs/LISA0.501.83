LIBRARIES AND SCIENCE.

THE MAIN CONCERN OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES SHOULD BE SPEEDY AND
EFFECTIVE SERVICE TO USERS. THEY MUST BE CONCERNED TO ELIMINATE ANY
UNNECESSARY DELAYS, WHICH MAY CAUSE DELAYS IN THE SCIENTIST'S WORK. LIBRARIANS
SHOULD TAKE AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE WORK OF THEIR USERS AND THEIR EDUCATION
AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO SO. A SURVEY IN THE SLOVAK
ACADEMY OF SCIENCE HAD SHOWN THAT MOST SOUGHT AFTER ARE INFORMATION SOURCES
1-3 YEARS OLD IN NATURAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE, 1-10 YEARS OLD IN THE SOCIAL
SCIENCES. GOOD ACQUISITION POLICY, QUALITY IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND INFORMATION
SERVICES CONTRIBUTE TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL
REVOLUTION.
