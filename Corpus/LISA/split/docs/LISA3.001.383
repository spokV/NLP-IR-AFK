USER REACTIONS TO PRECIS IN THE BRITISH EDUCATION INDEX.
     
REACTIONS OF USERS TO PRECIS (PRESERVED CONTEXT INDEX SYSTEM) SUBJECT INDEXING
IN BRITISH EDUCATION INDEX WERE STUDIED BY STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AS PART OF A
WIDER SURVEY OF PRECIS USER REACTION IN THE UK. FINDINGS ARE PRESENTED IN
TERMS OF EASE OF USE, EFFECTIVE RETRIEVAL OF CITATIONS, WHETHER TOO MUCH
INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN ENTRIES, THE STRUCTURE OF INDEX ENTRIES AND THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TERMS, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A '1-STAGE' INDEX.
CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT IN A SPECIALISED FIELD LIKE EDUCATION A SOPHISTICATED
INDEXING TECHNIQUE CANNOT OBVIATE THE INDEXER'S SPECIALISED SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE,
BUT THAT THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PRECIS ARE NOT UNDER ATTACK, AND ENTRIES
SHOULD NOT BE FURTHER SIMPLIFIED. A MAJORITY CONSIDERED PRECIS BETTER THAN THE
PUBLICATION'S PREVIOUS INDEXING METHOD.
