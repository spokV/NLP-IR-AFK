REPORT OF THE STUDY CONDUCTED IN INDIANA TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE
DIVISION OF INSTRUCTIONAL MEDIA IN ADMINISTERING THE ESEA IV-B PROGRAMME IN
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. STRONG POSITIVE SATISFACTION WAS SHOWN FOR THE DIVISION'S
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAMME, AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT MAJOR
CHANGES ARE REQUIRED IN ITS IV-B ACTIVITIES. IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE
GIVEN TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT ALL ARE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS OR REDIRECTION OF
ACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION OF THE INDIANA
ESEA IV-B PROGRAMME.
