A MODEL OF A DOCUMENT-CLUSTERING-BASED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM WITH A
BOOLEAN SEARCH REQUEST FORMULATION.
     
PRESENTS AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL METHOD WHICH CLUSTERS DOCUMENTS ON THE BASIS
OF PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED CLUSTERS OF BOOLEAN SEARCH REQUEST FORMULATIONS.
SUGGESTS WAYS OF SELECTING THESE FORMULATIONS AND DISCUSSES THE INFLUENCE OF
SELECTION METHOD ON RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE
METHOD WHICH PROVIDES RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS COMPARABLE TO THAT OBTAINED WITH
A SEQUENTIAL FILE. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS ARE ILLUSTRATED BY A NUMERICAL
EXAMPLE.
