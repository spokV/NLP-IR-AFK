IN SEARCH OF 'ETERNAL' PROBLEMS; YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE CLASSICS: THE CONDITIONS
FOR UNDERSTANDING.
     
LIBRARY FICTION ISSUES COMPRISE 2.5% OF TOTAL ISSUES, CLASSICS AMOUNTING TO 5%
OF THIS. IMPORTANCE OF PROMOTING CLASSICAL FICTION IS UNDERVALUED. CHILDREN
READ CLASSICS AS PART OF THE SCHOOL SYLLABUS BUT BID FAREWELL TO THEM ON
LEAVING. CLASSICAL LITERATURE'S ROLE IN EDUCATION IS UNDERESTIMATED BECAUSE OF
FEELINGS THAT CHILDREN ARE TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND THEM OR ARE NOT INTERESTED.
CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT HOW EVERYTHING 'INTERCONNECTS' IN RUSSIAN
LITERATURE, WHICH ASKS THE SAME ETERNAL QUESTIONS AS 'MODERNS'. RUSSIAN
CLASSICS OUGHT TO BECOME INDISPENSABLE TO YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES. SCHOOLS AND
LIBRARIES MUST FAMILIARISE CHILDREN WITH THE CLASSICS, COMBINING TOWARDS THEIR
INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT.
