THE RESULTS ARE IN-PRESERVATION WORKSHOPS ARE WANTED.
     
UNTIL RECENTLY, LIBRARY SCHOOLS IN THE US HAVE OFFERED LITTLE OR NOTHING IN
THEIR CURRICULUM ABOUT PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS. A PROJECT, INITIATED
BY THE LIBRARY/BINDERS COMMITTEE OF THE ALA PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS
SECTION, WAS CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF THE INTEREST IN
PRESERVATION WORKSHOPS. ATTENDEES OF RECENT WORKSHOPS WERE SURVEYED, AND
RESPONDEES INDICATED AN OVERWHELMING DESIRE TO ATTEND MORE WORKSHOPS AND TO
RECOMMEND WORKSHOP ATTENDANCE TO THEIR COLLEAGUES. RESPONSES ARE TABULATED IN
RELATION TO ASSESSMENT OF RESPONSES ABOUT PRESERVATION WORKSHOPS AND INTEREST
IN PRESERVATION WORKSHOP TOPICS.
