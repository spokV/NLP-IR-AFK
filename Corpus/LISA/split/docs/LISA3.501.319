SERVICES FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
     
REGIONAL SCHOOL LIBRARY CENTRES IN THE RHINELAND PALATINATE OFFER ADVICE AND
PRACTICAL ASSISTANCE TO GENERAL AND VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS CONCERNING SPATIAL
PLANNING AND EQUIPMENT, LIBRARY PROCEDURES SUCH AS CATALOGUING, PURCHASING,
LOANS AND THE USE OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA, AND ADMINISTRATION. THE CENTRES CAN
PROVIDE CRITICAL BOOK REVIEWS AND OPINIONS ON THE RANGE AND COSTS OF BOOKS.
THEY CAN ARRANGE BLOCK LOANS OF BOOKS TO SCHOOLS FROM THEIR OWN STOCKS AND
SUPPLY REQUESTED INDIVIDUAL TITLES THROUGH INTER-LIBRARY LOAN. THEY PREPARE
BASIC STOCK LISTS, DISSEMINATE INFORMATION AND ORGANISE CONFERENCES. THE
CENTRES NEED MORE STAFF IF THEY ARE TO KEEP PACE WITH DEMANDS BY SCHOOL
LIBRARIES FOR MORE CENTRALISED SERVICES.
