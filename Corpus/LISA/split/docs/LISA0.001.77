THE LIBRARY IN HIGHER PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION: AN EDUCATIONAL APPROACH.

IN 1972 A SURVEY OF LIBRARIES IN COLLEGES OF HIGHER PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION IN
THE NETHERLANDS REVEALED A LOW STANDARD OF LIBRARY PROVISION. AS A RESULT THE
STATE LIBRARY ADVISORY COUNCIL HAS PUBLISHED A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS FOR THE
IMPROVEMENT OF SERVICES. MODERN TRENDS IN HIGHER EDUCATION, SUCH AS INCREASED
STUDENT NUMBERS AND NEW METHODS IN TEACHING, HAVE HAD A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE
COLLEGES OF HIGHER PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. LIBRARIES OF THESE COLLEGES MUST
NOW BECOME INFORMATION CENTRES, EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL STUDENTS AND EQUIPPED
WITH ADEQUATE CATALOGUES. COLLEGE LIBRARIANS WILL NEED TO PAY INCREASING
ATTENTION TO THE ACQUISITION OF REPORTS, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS AND
AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS AND SHOULD PROVIDE COURSES OF FORMAL INSTRUCTION FOR
STAFF AND STUDENTS IN THE USE OF LIBRARY SERVICES.
