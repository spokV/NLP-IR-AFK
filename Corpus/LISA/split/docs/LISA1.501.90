THE AGENT AND THE LEARNER' INTERACTIONS IN ASSISTED ADULT LIBRARY LEARNING.
     
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ADULT INDEPENDENT LEARNERS AND ASSISTING LIBRARIANS WERE
EXAMINED USING THE CRITICAL INCIDENT TECHNIQUE, A MEANS FOR ELICITING
NARRATIVE DATA. 39 LEARNER'S ADVISORS PROVIDED DESCRIPTIONS OF IMPORTANT
EFFECTIVE AND INEFFECTIVE ENCOUNTERS WITH ADULTS WHO SOUGHT NEW SKILLS OR
KNOWLEDGE THROUGH SYSTEMATIC LIBRARY ASSISTANCE. THE AGENT AND THE LEARNER
CREATE COMPLEX ENCOUNTERS IN WHICH THE INFORMATION GIVEN IS LESS IMPORTANT TO
LEARNING THAN THE QUALITY OF THE GIVING.
