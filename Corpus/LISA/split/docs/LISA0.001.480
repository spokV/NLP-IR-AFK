ETHICAL PROBLEMS IN BOOK PUBLISHING.

PRESENTS THE METHODS AND RESULTS OF AN INDUCTIVE INQUIRY INTO THE ETHICS OF
140 PRACTITIONERS IN BOOK PUBLISHING IN THE USA. THE MOST EXPLICIT CONCERNS
EXPRESSED BY THE PUBLISHERS SURVEYED WERE FOR: QUALITY IN ALL EDITORIAL AND
PRODUCTION PROCESSES; HANDLING MORALLY THE TENSIONS BETWEEN AUTHORS AND
EDITORS; TREATING SUPPORT PERSONNEL FAIRLY; AND PROMOTING MATERIALS
TRUTHFULLY. CONCLUDES THAT PARTICIPANTS REFLECT A CLASSICAL LIBERAL VIEW OF
FREE EXPRESSION, AND ARGUES THAT FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO BOOK PUBLISHING'S
AWARENESS OF ITS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IS NEEDED.
