LITERATURE AND READING IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.
     
STATISTICS FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS IN EAST GERMANY REFLECT THE SUCCESS ACHIEVED
BY THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY IN STIMULATING PUBLIC INTEREST IN READING AND IN
TRYING TO SATISFY READERS' NEEDS. THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING THE WIDEST
POSSIBLE RANGE OF MATERIAL ON DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IS
RECOGNISED. FOREIGN MATERIAL MOST IN DEMAND IS THAT FROM THE USSR, FOLLOWED BY
WORKS FROM OTHER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES AND FROM THE THIRD WORLD. NATURALLY A
WIDE RANGE OF CONTEMPORARY DOMESTIC LITERATURE IS ALSO AVAILABLE. IN 1980,
LIBRARY STOCKS TOTALLED 80 MILLION ITEMS AND THE BOOKTRADE TURNOVER HAS
INCREASED BY 32% DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS. CLOSE LINKS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED
BETWEEN AUTHORS, PUBLISHERS AND THE PUBLIC. MORE RESEARCH INTO READING HABITS
AND COMMUNICATION THROUGH LITERATURE IS REQUIRED.
