THE LIBRARY TECHNICIAN AND THE DOCUMENTATION TECHNICIAN: TWELVE YEARS LATER.

COMPARES THE RESULTS OF A 1980 QUEBEC SURVEY OF DOCUMENTATION TECHNICIANS WITH
A 1975 SURVEY OF LIBRARY TECHNICIANS, TO ASSESS THE CHANGES RESULTING FROM THE
INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW QUALIFICATION. THE MAIN CONCLUSION IS THAT WHILE NEW
RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE BEEN CREATED, THERE ARE STILL NO REAL CAREER
OPPORTUNITIES FOR NON-PROFESSIONAL LIBRARY STAFF.
