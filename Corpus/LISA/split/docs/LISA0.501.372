VIP MANUAL' GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES FOR ERIC VOCABULARY IMPROVEMENT.

THIS MANUAL WAS DEVELOPED FOR USE BY ERIC PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THE 2 1/2 YEAR
VOCABULARY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (VIP) WHICH CULMINATED IN THE PUBLICATION OF
THE 1980 COMPLETELY REVISED EDITION OF THE THESAURUS OF ERIC DESCRITORS. BASED
ON THE IDEA THAT INDEXING IS NOT ABOUT DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTS BUT ABOUT
RETRIEVAL, IT APPLIES CRITERIA DERIVED FROM THE CAPABILITIES OF MANUAL AND
ON-LINE RETRIEVAL TO EXAMPLES OF THESAURAL PROBLEMS. PROJECT PROCEDURES AND
PRINCIPLES FOR VOCABULARY IMPROVEMENT ARE PRESENTED IN THE FIRST 2 SECTIONS,
FOLLOWED BY DETAILED DISCUSSIONS OF THE FUNCTIONS AND TREATMENT OF MAIN TERMS,
SCOPE NOTES, AND USE/USE FOR REFERENCES. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
