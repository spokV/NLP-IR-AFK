HIERARCHICAL ARCHITECTURE FOR COMPUTER MAIL SYSTEMS.
     
AN ARCHITECTURAL MODEL FOR LARGE, DISTRIBUTED COMPUTER MAIL SYSTEMS IS
PRESENTED. THIS MODEL SPECIFIES' A MINIMUM SET OF FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS THAT
SUPPORTS ALL COMPUTER MAIL FUNCTIONS; THE FUNCTIONS AND STRUCTURE OF EACH
COMPONENT; THE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL NEEDED FOR INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION;
AND THE ORGANISATION OF THE IDENTIFICATION DATA BASE USED TO SUPPORT
IDENTIFICATION SERVICES IN THE ARCHITECTURE. THE COMPUTER MAIL PROTOCOL OF THE
ARCHITECTURE IS SPECIFIED FOLLOWING THE FRAMEWORK OF THE REFERENCE MODEL FOR
OPEN SYSTEM ARCHITECTURES PROPOSED BY THE ISO, AND EACH LAYER OF THE PROTOCOL
IS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. THE ORGANISATION OF THE IDENTIFICATION DATA BASE IS
BASED ON THE SAME LAYERING CONCEPT, AND SPECIAL EMPHASIS IS GIVEN TO THE ROLE
OF IDENTIFICATION SERVICES IN LARGE SYSTEMS AND THE INTERCONNECTION OF VARIOUS
SYSTEMS.
