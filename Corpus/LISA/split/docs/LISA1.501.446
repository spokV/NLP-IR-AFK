SOFT TYPOGRAPHY.
     
IMPROVEMENTS IN DIGITAL VIDEO TYPOGRAPHY ARE SEEN AS A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF
INCREASED INTERACTIVITY AND SCOPE OF USE OF SOFT COPY TEXT DISPLAY SYSTEMS. A
GRAYSCALING SCHEME PRODUCES HIGH-QUALITY FONTS FOR DISPLAY WITH STANDARD
COLOUR VIDEO EQUIPMENT, REDUCING SCINTILLATION, SMOOTHING CURVES, AND
IMPROVING ENCODABILITY. THE SAME CONCEPT ALLOWS A 'VIRTUAL RESOLUTION' FAR
BEYOND THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF NORMAL PIXEL SIZE, PERMITTING UP TO 80
CHARACTERS PER LINE OF READABLE TEXT ON COLOUR TELEVISIONS.
