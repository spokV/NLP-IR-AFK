CONSERVATION AND COLLECTION MANAGEMENT' EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES.
     
LIBRARY AND ARCHIVAL CONSERVATION HAS SUFFERED FROM A LACK OF PROFESSIONAL
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE USA. ITS EMPHASIS ON APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING
CANNOT ENGENDER A CAPACITY FOR RESEARCH, BUT THE 4 GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN THE
USA AND CANADA STRESS ART CONSERVATION WITH ITS ATTENDANT FOCUS ON ARTIFACT
RESTORATION, RATHER THAN COLLECTION CONSERVATION IN ARCHIVES AND LIBRARIES.
ALTHOUGH THE NATIONAL CONSERVATION ADVISORY COUNCIL HAS ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE,
A.L.A.-ACCREDITED LIBRARY SCHOOLS PROGRAMMES HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RESPOND
POSITIVELY. RECENT EFFORTS ARE DISCUSSED, ESPECIALLY THE CURRICULA AT COLUMBIA
UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND.
