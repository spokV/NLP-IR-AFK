THE FINANCING OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
THE DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCING METHODS FOR SOUTH AFRICAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IS
SKETCHED, FROM THE SUBSCRIPTION LIBRARY TO THE PARTNERSHIP SYSTEM IN WHICH
COSTS OF LOCAL LIBRARIES ARE SHARED BETWEEN THE PROVINCIAL LIBRARY SERVICES
AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THE VARIOUS APPROACHES FOLLOWED IN THE 4 SOUTH
AFRICAN PROVINCES ARE INDICATED. A GREAT NEED EXISTS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ON
THE FINANCING OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES. PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE LARGE CITIES
ESPECIALLY ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE FINANCING.
