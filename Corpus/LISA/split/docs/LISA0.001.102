TIME-EDUCATION-INFORMATION: DISCUSSION NEEDED SO THAT THE SCHOOL LIBRARY CAN
FUNCTION.

CONCLUSIONS FROM A SCANDINAVIAN SCHOOL LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE HELD AT
LEANGKOLLEN, NORWAY, JULY 80, INCLUDED THE SCHOOL LIBRARY'S ALL-EMBRACING
FUNCTION; THE PRE-EMINENCE OF DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN SCANDINAVIA; THE NEED
FOR NORWEGIAN AUTHORITIES TO CARRY OUT THE INTENTIONS OF THE LIBRARY ACT; AND
SCHOOL LIBRARIES' IMPORTANT ROLE IN SCANDINAVIAN CULTURAL COOPERATION. TOPICS
INCLUDED A FORWARD VIEW OF THE SCHOOL'S AIMS AND CURRICULUM; THE CHALLENGE OF
SUPPLYING SUITABLE EDUCATION FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL CHILD IN THE 1980S; THE
STAFFING QUESTION, TEACHER TRAINING BEING SEEN AS MORE VALUABLE THAN ADVANCED
LIBRARY STUDIES; THE NEW TERM 'MEDIA CENTRE', APTLY DESCRIBING THE TRUE
FUNCTION OF A SCHOOL LIBRARY; AND FAIRY TALES IN EDUCATION. THE SCHOOL LIBRARY
IS AN IMPORTANT AID TOWARDS LEARNING OTHER SCANDINAVIAN LANGUAGES AT THE
EARLIEST POSSIBLE AGE. ESSENTIALS IN NORWAY ARE: A SUFFICIENT ALLOWANCE OF
TIME FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARIAN IN THE CURRICULUM; ADEQUATE EDUCATION FOR SCHOOL
LIBRARIANS; AND INFORMATION AND DISCUSSION ON THE NORWEGIAN SCHOOL LIBRARY
SYSTEM.
