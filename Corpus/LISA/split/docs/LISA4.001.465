A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC AND PROFESSIONAL CHARACTERISTICS
OF AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION EXECUTIVE BOARD AND COUNCIL MEMBERS, 1876-1917.
     
BY USING THE COMPUTER TO COMPARE SOCIOECONOMIC AND PROFESSIONAL
CHARACTERISTICS OF ALA EXECUTIVE BOARD AND COUNCIL MEMBERS BETWEEN 1876 AND
1917, IDENTIFIES A COLLECTIVE PROFILE OF BOTH GROUPS IN ORDER TO TEST THE
HYPOTHESIS THAT THE COUNCIL WAS MORE 'DEMOCRATIC' THAN THE EXECUTIVE BOARD.
TEST RESULTS REVEAL CONSIDERABLE HOMOGENEITY THROUGHOUT THE 41-YEAR ANALYSIS
PERIOD, BUT THE PERIOD FROM 1900-1917 DOES DEMONSTRATE SEVERAL HETEROGENEOUS
AREAS WORTHY OF FURTHER STUDY.
