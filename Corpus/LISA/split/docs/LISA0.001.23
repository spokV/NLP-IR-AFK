PROFESSIONAL ETHICS.

CRITIQUE OF THE DRAFT CODE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION. THE CODE IS BADLY WRITTEN, CONFUSED, SILLY, CONTRADICTORY AND
THREATENS TO BRING THE LA INTO DISREPUTE. NOTES PROVIDE LITTLE ILLUMINATION;
CODES OF ETHICS DO NOT PER SE BRING PROFESSIONALISM; A LIBRARIAN'S PRIMARY
DUTY IS OFTEN TO A CORPORATE BODY; THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT POSSIBLE CONFLICTS
IN SERVICE; AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS IMPUDENT IN SUGGESTING THAT IT WILL
IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THOSE WHO FAIL TO KEEP ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS IN
LIBRARIANSHIP. SUGGESTS THAT THE WORKING PARTY WOULD DO WELL TO REFER TO THE
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION CODE.
