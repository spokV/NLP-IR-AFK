SOME IMPRESSIONS OF CANADIAN MAP LIBRARIANS AND THEIR COLLECTIONS.

A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF 4 ONTARIO MAP COLLECTIONS VISITED BY THE AUTHOR-AT THE
UNIVERSITIES OF TRENT, BROCK, AND TORONTO, AND THE NATIONAL MAP COLLECTION IN
OTTAWA. THE VISITS CONFIRMED THAT THE BEST STAFF QUALIFICATIONS ARE COMMON
SENSE, ENTHUSIASM, AND A LOVE OF THE MEDIUM; A NATIONAL MAP COLLECTION NEED
NOT BE HELD BY A NATIONAL LIBRARY; MAP LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES CAN FORM
ADVANTAGEOUS LINKS; THERE SHOULD BE A SPECIFIC MAP CLASSIFICATION CODE; A MAP
LIBRARY'S ACTIVITIES SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT COLLECTION SIZE AND USER
NUMBERS; AND ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT OPINIONS IN THE PROFESSION ARE VALUABLE, IT IS
TOO YOUNG A PROFESSION TO ENDURE DISSENT AS VIOLENT AS THAT IN THE USA, WHERE
IT HAS BEEN SPLIT INTO 4 FACTIONS.
