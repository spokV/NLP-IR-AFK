CONTINUING EDUCATION IN THE 80S' THOUGHTS OF A SERVICE LIBRARIAN.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON EDUCATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
WORK. NEW ASPECTS OF LIBRARIANSHIP-CHANGES IN CATALOGUING RULES, IN USE OF NEW
FORMS OF THE CATALOGUE, THE PROLIFERATION OF NEW REFERENCE SOURCES, ON-LINE
SEARCHING IN BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASES AND OTHER INNOVATIONS-WILL MAKE USE OF
UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE LIBRARIES BY PATRONS MORE DIFFICULT IN THE FUTURE. THE
CRUCIAL PROBLEM FOR SERVICE LIBRARIANS IS KEEPING UP WITH THESE ASPECTS
THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO INSTRUCT, INFORM AND ASSIST THE USER. SHARING OF
KNOWLEDGE IS SUGGESTED AS A MEANS FOR INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIANS TO KEEP UP WITH
NEW DEVELOPMENTS; SHARING THROUGH PUBLICATIONS, CONFERENCES AND WORKSHOPS,
AUDIO-VISUAL PROGRAMMES AND IN-HOUSE TRAINING SESSIONS.
