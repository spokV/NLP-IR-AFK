TURKISH CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS AS LIBRARY USERS.
     
LIBRARIANS KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE VIEWS OF FOREIGN WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES
ON LIBRARIES; MANY OF THESE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND LITTLE GERMAN. IN JULY 80 MUNICH
MUNICIPAL LIBRARY PRODUCED A QUESTIONNAIRE FOR TURKISH CHILDREN, INCLUDING
QUESTIONS ON AGE, SEX, SCHOOLS AND TYPES OF CLASS, LENGTH OF TIME IN GERMANY,
ABILITY TO READ GERMAN, LIBRARY USE AND LIKES AND DISLIKES CONCERNING BOOKS,
CASSETTES AND LIBRARY FACILITIES. LANGUAGE PROBLEMS LED TO SOME
MISUNDERSTANDINGS; THE DESIGN OF FUTURE QUESTIONNAIRES MUST BE IMPROVED.
RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE AVERAGE READER IS 10-13 YEARS OLD, MALE, IN A TURKISH
CLASS AT SCHOOL AND CAN READ SOME GERMAN BOOKS. HE CAME TO GERMANY WITHIN THE
LAST 4 YEARS, LEARNT ABOUT THE LIBRARY FROM FRIENDS, HAS A READER'S TICKET AND
VISITS THE LIBRARY AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK.
