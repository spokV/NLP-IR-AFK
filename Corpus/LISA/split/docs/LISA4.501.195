THE CULTURAL POLICY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
     
THE TEXT OF A TALK GIVEN TO A CONFERENCE ON LIBRARIES IN THE ICY WIND OF
CULTURAL POLICY, HELD IN JARFALLA, MAY 81. IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE CULTURAL
POLICY THE CULTURAL PRODUCERS MUST INFORM THEMSELVES OF THE WHOLE SPHERE OF
LOCAL POLITICS. LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE NO LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES AND LEGISLATION LAYING DOWN MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES,
AS IN FINLAND, SHOULD BE ENACTED. AFTER THE BOOM IN THE 60S AND 70S, THE LOCAL
AUTHORITIES HAVE TO MAKE CUTS; AS THEY CANNOT REDUCE PREVIOUS CAPITAL
INVESTMENT THEY CUT CURRENT EXPENDITURE ON CULTURAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SCHOOLS
AND LIBRARIES, ALTHOUGH MONEY SEEMS ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR SPORT, BUREAUCRACY
AND DATA TECHNOLOGY. THE REAL POWER OF DECISION-MAKING LIES NOT WITH THE
CULTURAL, BUT WITH THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUDGETING.
CULTURAL CONSUMERS SHOULD BE AS POLITICALLY ACTIVE AS THE PRESSURE GROUPS FOR
SPORT AND TRY TO INFLUENCE LOCAL POLITICIANS,  IF A CATASTROPHE FOR CULTURE IS
TO BE AVERTED.
