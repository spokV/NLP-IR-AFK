PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS A COMPULSORY PROVISION BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
     
AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE POSITION OF LOCAL AUTHORITY
CULTURAL SERVICES MUST BE CLARIFIED IN THE 1980S. THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS A
PART OF LOCAL CULTURE THAT CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED AND SO IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR
EACH LIBRARY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER LIBRARIES, CULTURAL ORGANISATIONS AND
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATORS. A DECISION IS NEEDED AS TO WHETHER LOCAL
AUTHORITIES ARE NOT ONLY ENTITLED BUT ALSO OBLIGED TO ADMINISTER PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. THE CONCEPT OF A NATIONAL LIBRARY LAW SHOULD BE RENOUNCED IN FAVOUR
OF A CONCEPT WHEREBY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IMPOSE ON THEMSELVES THE OBLIGATION TO
PROVIDE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. LOCAL COMMUNITIES SHOULD DRAW UP THEIR OWN LIBRARY
PLANS AND PROVIDE THE MONEY; EACH STATE SHOULD THEN PROVIDE FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE FOR LIBRARY WORK OUTSIDE THESE AREAS.
