LENDING MUSIC IN TAMPERE.

THE TAMPERE CITY LIBRARY STARTED AN EXPERIMENTAL MUSIC LENDING SERVICE IN
1975. 3 YEARS LATER THE SERVICE WAS ESTABLISHED PERMANENTLY. THE MUSIC WORKING
GROUP OF THE LIBRARY REPORTS THAT A RECORD LASTS ABOUT 40-50 LOANS AND
RETURNED RECORDS ARE GENERALLY IN GOOD CONDITION. BETWEEN 1975-79 ABOUT 81,000
RECORDS WERE LOANED. THE EXPERIENCES FROM THE SERVICES ARE ONLY POSITIVE.
THERE ARE ABOUT 4,000 RECORDS IN STOCK. THEY ARE LOANED FOR 7 WEEKS. THE
LIBRARY ALSO HAS LISTENING FACILITIES.
