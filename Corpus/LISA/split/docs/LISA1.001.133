MULTIPLE AUTHORSHIP AND AUTHOR COLLABORATION IN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
PUBLICATIONS.

THE INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF MULTIPLE AUTHOR PAPERS AND THE INCREASE IN
THE NUMBER OF AUTHORS PER PAPER IN AN AGRICULTURAL JOURNAL OVER THE PERIOD
1958 TO 1978 ARE DESCRIBED. THE FREQUENCY OF SINGLE-AUTHOR PAPERS DROPS FROM
65.5% IN 1958 TO 34.3% IN 1978 AND THE FREQUENCY OF 2-AUTHOR PAPERS INCREASES
FROM 28.1% TO 41.4%. OVER THE SAME PERIOD THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF AUTHORS PER
PAPER INCREASES FROM 1.43 TO 1.99 (MAXIMUM 2.16 IN 1976). POSSIBLE
CORRELATIONS BETWEEN AUTHOR AFFILIATIONS AND MULTIPLE AUTHORSHIP ARE
SUGGESTED; AUTHORS IN NEW ZEALAND APPEAR PREFERENTIALLY TO COLLABORATE WITH
CO-AUTHORS IN THE SAME TYPE OF INSTITUTION.
