ON THE COMPLEXITIES OF ASKING QUESTIONS. DIFFICULTIES IN INTERPRETATION OF
LIBRARY SURVEYS.

IN AN INVESTIGATION INTO HOW PEOPLE DIFFER IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF QUESTIONS
IN LIBRARY-USER SURVEYS, A RELATIVELY HOMOGENEOUS GROUP (STUDENTS ON A
METHODOLOGY COURSE AND THEIR ACQUAINTANCES) WAS ASKED TO COMPLETE A 2-PART
QUESTIONNAIRE. PART 1 DESCRIBED SITUATIONS THAT OFTEN OCCUR IN A LIBRARY AND
TYPES OF CONTACT WITH READING MATERIAL AND ASKED RESPONDENTS WHETHER THEY
WOULD CALL EACH 'LIBRARY USE'. PART 2 DESCRIBED THE FREQUENCY OF SITUATIONS
AND ASKED FOR AN APPROPRIATE ADVERB, SUCH AS 'SELDOM' OR 'OFTEN'. THE
RESPONSES SHOWED A SURPRISING VARIATION, AN INDICATION THAT THE QUESTIONNAIRE
PROCEDURE COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS DISTORTION IF USED IN A QUANTITATIVE
INVESTIGATION.
