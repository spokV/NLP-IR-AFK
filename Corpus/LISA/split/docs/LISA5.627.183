NATIONAL-LEVEL COOPERATIVE REFERENCE SERVICES' A REACTION.

PAPER PRESENTED AS A REACTION TO PREVIOUS SPEECHES AT THE REFERENCE AND ADULT
SERVICES DIVISION COOPERATIVE REFERENCE SERVICE COMMITTEE PROGRAMME AT THE
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ANNUAL CONFERENCE, SAN FRANCISCO, 29 JUNE 81.
PUTS THE POINT OF VIEW OF OREGAN STATE LIBRARY REGARDING ITS INVOLVEMENT IN
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS REFERENCE CORRESPONDENCE REFERRAL PROGRAMME (2SEE1
82/5808) AND BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE SLAVIC REFERENCE
SERVICE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS (2SEE1 82/5812) AND THE BRITISH LIBRARY
LENDING DIVISION. CONCLUDES THAT IF A NATIONAL-LEVEL REFERRAL SYSTEM IS NOT TO
BE OVERLOADED WITH INAPPROPRIATE REQUESTS THAT UNNECESSARILY INCREASE THE
COSTS, THERE MUST BE ADEQUATE LOCAL REFERENCE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO ALL US
RESIDENTS AND A PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THESE LOCAL SERVICES.
