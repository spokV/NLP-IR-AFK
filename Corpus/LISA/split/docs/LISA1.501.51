A LICK AND A PROMISE?: FRANS STEIN'S INTERVIEW WITH FRANS VAN DE ROER ON THE
FUTURE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES.
     
THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN AN INTERVIEW WITH FRANS STEIN IN BIBLIOTHEEK EN
SAMENLEVING 8 (11) NOV 80, 311-316 (SEE 81/3084), BY FRANS VAN DE ROER, HEAD
OF THE LIBRARY SECTION AT THE DUTCH MINISTRY OF CULTURE, RECREATION AND SOCIAL
SERVICES REPRESENT A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE
NETHERLANDS. IN SPITE OF GOVERNMENT ASSURANCES THAT ACCESS TO INFORMATION
SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL SECTIONS OF THE PUBLIC, VAN DE ROER IS CLEARLY IN
FAVOUR OF INCREASING MEMBERSHIP CHARGES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN AN EFFORT TO
REDUCE GOVERNMENT SPENDING. LIBRARIANS MUST CONVINCE THE AUTHORITIES THAT
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES SHOULD BE REGARDED AS PART OF A NATIONAL INFORMATION
POLICY AND NOT AS PART OF THE LOCAL SOCIO-CULTURAL SERVICES.
