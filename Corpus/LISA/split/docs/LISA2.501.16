BULGARIAN PERIODICALS AS AN INFORMATION SOURCE ON LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
ONE OF THE SPECIAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES PUBLISHED BY THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS
NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA COVERS LITERATURE ON LIBRARIANSHIP, BIBLIOGRAPHY AND
INFORMATION SCIENCE. FROM 1967-76, 4330 HEADINGS WERE LISTED. MORE THAN 90%
WERE ARTICLES AND SPECIAL PAPERS, AND ONLY THE REMAINING 10% INCLUDED BOOKS.
NATIONAL DAILIES AS WELL AS REGIONAL AND LOCAL PAPERS ALSO PAID ATTENTION TO
LIBRARIES. THEY EMPHASISED, HOWEVER, MOSTLY GENERAL ISSUES OR TOPICS OF LOCAL
INTEREST AND TIMING FREQUENCY AS WELL AS STANDARDS VARIED CONSIDERABLY. SINCE
1954, 2BIBLIOTEKAR1 HAS BEEN ALMOST THE ONLY STABLE PERIODICAL FOR LIBRARIANS
AND HAS SO FAR REMAINED THE ONLY BULGARIAN PERIODICAL OF THIS KIND KNOWN AND
ABSTRACTED ABROAD. INFORMATION SCIENTISTS HAVE LACKED THEIR OWN SPECIAL
PERIODICAL. THE GAP HAS BEEN PARTLY FILLED BY THE EFFORT OF THE CENTRAL
LIBRARY OF THE BULGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.
