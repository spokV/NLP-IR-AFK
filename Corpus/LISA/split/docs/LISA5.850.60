HEALTH CARE MICROTHESAURUS' A HIERARCHIAL LIST OF INDEXING TERMS USED BY NTIS.

THE MICROTHESAURUS WAS PREPARED BY NTIS TO HELP NTIS DATA BASE USERS RETRIEVE
HEALTH CARE RELATED REPORTS AND TO PROVIDE AN INDEXING VOCABULARY FOR THE
HEALTH CARE INFORMATION COMMUNITY. MORE THAN 1,400 MAIN TERMS AND THEIR
HIERARCHIES ARE LISTED, EXPRESSING HEALTH CARE CONCEPTS INCLUDING THOSE FOR
HEALTH CARE COSTS, EDUCATION, DELIVERY, AND OCCUPATIONS. ALSO INCLUDED ARE
TERMS COVERING RESOURCES, MANPOWER, TECHNOLOGY, SERVICES, USE, AND
LEGISLATION. IN SOME INSTANCES A SHORT DEFINITION HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO CLARIFY
A SPECIAL USE OF A TERM BY NTIS.
