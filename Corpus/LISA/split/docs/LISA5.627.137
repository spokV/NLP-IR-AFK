SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION-A PRE-CONDITION OF SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS.

IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA, CENTRES OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION
ARE AT PRESENT IN OPERATION NOT ONLY IN DESIGN CENTRES AND RESEARCH
INSTITUTES, BUT ALSO IN ALL LARGER FACTORIES. THE CORE OF SUCH A CENTRE IS THE
TECHNICAL LIBRARY. IN MOST LIBRARIES, PERIODICALS AND MONOGRAPHS STILL
PREVAIL, BUT LATELY PATENTS, STANDARDS, DISSERTATIONS, RESEARCH REPORTS, TRADE
CATALOGUES AND DOCUMENTARY FILMS ARE AVAILABLE. THE CENTRES' ACTIVITIES
DEPEND, OF COURSE, VERY MUCH ON STAFF AND EQUIPMENT. BUILDING UP DATA AND
DOCUMENTATION BASES, UNDER EXPLORATION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL RESOURCES, IS
OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE. TRANSLATIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM FOREIGN LANGUAGES
INTO SLOVAK AND CZECH ARE ALSO AVAILABLE. INFORMATION USERS ARE TAUGHT TO USE
INFORMATION SOURCES MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. IN ADDITION TO OTHER
RELEVANT ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THEIR OWN CONTINUING EDUCATION, INFORMATION
SCIENT ISTS AND OTHER STAFF SHOULD ENGAGE IN THEORETICAL STUDIES AND RESEARCH,
THE RESULTS OF WHICH SHOULD BE PUBLISHED WHEREVER POSSIBLE.
