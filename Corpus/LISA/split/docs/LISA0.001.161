THE EXAMPLE OF THE 'MARBURG MODEL'.

CRITICAL SUMMARY OF THE PROGRESS MADE IN INTRODUCING A COORDINATED LIBRARY
SYSTEM AT MARBURG UNIVERSITY WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY SUITED AS A MODEL FOR THIS
PURPOSE BECAUSE THE CENTRAL ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUE HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE
THE 19TH CENTURY AND HAD BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY EXTENDED SINCE 1962; AND NEW
BUILDINGS FOR MANY OF THE LIBRARY FACILITIES HAVE LED TO EXCELLENT LENDING
CONDITIONS AND CLOSE PROXIMITY BETWEEN UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS AND LIBRARY
SERVICES. THE COORDINATION PROGRAMME AIMS AT, AND HAS PARTIALLY REALISED THE
INTEGRATION OF MANY SMALL INSTITUTE LIBRARIES INTO 28 LIBRARY COMPLEXES WITH
52 INDEPENDANT LIBRARY UNITS. ONE IMPORTANT MEASURE IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF A
CENTRAL MEDICAL LIBRARY INTEGRATING THE PRESENT 37 DEPARTMENT LIBRARIES. IT IS
POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT THE PROGRAMME INITIATED AT MARBURG WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED
COOPERATION AND INTEGRATION IN THE LIBRARY SERVICE AND WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR
UNIVERSITIES OF A SIMILAR STRUCTURE.
