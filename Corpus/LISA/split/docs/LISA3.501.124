HOW DO YOU GET ON WITH THE STUDENTS?.
     
THERE ARE OVER 34,000 STUDENTS AT BONN UNIVERSITY, 60% OF WHOM LIVE IN THE
TOWN, SO THAT THEIR NEEDS MUST BE CATERED FOR BY BONN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
STUDENTS FROM COLOGNE AND AACHEN UNIVERSITIES ALSO MAKE USE OF BONN'S LIBRARY
SERVICES. IF A STUDENT CANNOT FIND THE REQUIRED MATERIAL IN THE UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY HE TURNS TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY FOR HELP. IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY HE
FINDS THE ADVANTAGES OF LONG OPENING HOURS AND OF ALL MEDIA ON OPEN ACCESS. IN
1980 15.73% OF ALL LOANS IN BONN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE MADE TO UNIVERSITY
STUDENTS; THEY USED MAINLY ACADEMIC MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY SOCIOLOGY. THE STATE
PROVIDES 13.1% OF TOTAL LIBRARY FUNDS FOR SPECIALISED MATERIAL.
