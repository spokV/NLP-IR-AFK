DIVERSIFYING FISCAL SUPPORT BY PRICING PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES' A POLICY
IMPACT ANALYSIS.

ADDRESSES THE POSSIBILITY OF DIVERSIFYING THE RESOURCE BASE OF US LOCAL PUBLIC
LIBRARY SYSTEMS WHICH CURRENTLY ARE CRITICALLY DEPENDENT ON PROPERTY TAXES FOR
THEIR FUNDING. OFFERS A CASE FOR PRICING LIBRARY SERVICES, AND AN EMPIRICAL
ANALYSIS OF SUCH A POLICY WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE DALLAS PUBLIC LIBRARY
SYSTEM IS REPORTED. EMPLOYING A DELIBERATE SEQUENCE OF SIGNIFICANCE TESTS
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF AN INTERRUPTED TIME-SERIES, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN TO
STUDY THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAMME ON SERVICE DEMAND, THE RESULTS ARE EVALUATED
WITH RESPECT TO SEVERAL ECONOMIC AND EVALUATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERA. WHILE
SUCH A USER-CHARGE POLICY MAY NOT BE WHOLLY ADEQUATE OR EFFICIENT, IT IS
EFFECTIVE, PROMOTES EQUITY, AND IS DEEMED APPROPRIATE TO SUPPLEMENT CURRENT
FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS.
