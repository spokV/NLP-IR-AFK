THE ACQUISITION OF AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION-A TASK FOR
LIBRARIES?.

LIBRARIES SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACQUIRING 2INFORMATIONSMITTEL1 AS DEFINED
BY GEORG SCHMOLL SUPPLYING A SUMMARISED FORM OF INFORMATION SOURCES AND
PRESENTING IT TO THE USER IN A PRACTICAL FORM. AT PRESENT THIS TYPE OF
MATERIAL (BIBLIOGRAPHICAL MATERIAL, INCLUDING LIBRARY CATALOGUES) IS NOT
COLLECTED BY LIBRARIES IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AS IT IS OFTEN NOT AVAILABLE
THROUGH NORMAL MARKET SOURCES VIA PUBLISHERS. AS INFORMATION MATERIAL IS
GENERALLY IN A PROCESSED FORM, LIBRARIES DO NOT ALWAYS CLASSIFY THE CONTENTS
FURTHER. HOWEVER, THE FORM IN WHICH THE MATERIAL IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE USER
IS VERY IMPORTANT AS IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE INDEPENDENT USE OF THE
INFORMATION. OFTEN THE MATERIAL IS CLASSIFIED TO BE USED BY PARTICULAR USER
GROUPS, FIRMS, LIBRARY COLLECTIVES OR SECTORS OF THE INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM. LIBRARIES MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHICH USER GROUPS
NEED WHICH INFORMATION MATERIAL IN THEIR AREA AND ALSO WORK WITH OTHER
LIBRARIES TO PROVIDE A LARGER SELECTION OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
INFORMATION MATERIAL.
