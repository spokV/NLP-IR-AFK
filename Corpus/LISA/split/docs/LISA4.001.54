THE FUTURE COURSE OF ARCHIVAL THEORY IN THE UNITED STATES.
     
ARCHIVISTS WISHING TO PURSUE THE CONCEPT OF ARCHIVAL THEORY MUST FIRST DEFINE
THAT CONCEPT AND THEN WEIGH THEIR DEFINITION AGAINST THE WORK DONE IN THE
FIELD SO FAR. ONE APPROACH WOULD BE TO CONSIDER THEORY AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF
UNIVERSAL LAWS, AND TO FRAME HYPOTHESES IN UNIVERSAL FORM AND TEST THEM
AGAINST THE EVIDENCE. ADDRESSES THE LIKELY FUTURE TRENDS IN US ARCHIVAL THEORY
AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, CONCLUDING THAT THERE IS HOPE FOR THE PROFESSION IF'
(1) THE PROFESSION ITSELF REALISES THAT IT IS BOTH A SCIENCE AND A CRAFT; AND
(2) CERTAIN ARCHIVISTS MAKE THE MOVE FROM THE WORKPLACE TO THE ACADEMY AS A
PERMANENT CAREER COMMITMENT. THERE THEY MUST REALIGN THEMSELVES WITH ACADEMIC
HISTORIANS AND OTHERS TO PRODUCE A BODY OF BASIC PRINCIPLES, A SYSTEM OF
IMMUTABLE LAWS-A LITANY OF THEORY AND DOGMA.
