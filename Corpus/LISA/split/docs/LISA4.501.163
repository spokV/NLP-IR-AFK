LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST AUSTRIAN-SOVIET SEMINAR ON THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN
A COUNTRY'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL LIFE, HELD AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY,
20-22 MAR 79. THE REFORM OF AUSTRIAN RESEARCH LIBRARIES STARTED WITH THE
ESTABLISHMENT IN 1970 OF THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND RESEARCH UNDER
WHOSE JURISDICTION NOW BELONGS 60% OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THE CENTRALISATION
HAS PROVED BENEFICIAL FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT PLANNING. IN 1975 THE LAW ON
UNIVERSITY ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE WAS PASSED RESULTING IN THE REORGANISATION
OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WITH THE AIM OF BUILDING A COORDINATED AND INTEGRATED
LIBRARY SYSTEM BASED ON UNIFIED PRINCIPLES. ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE,
FUNCTIONS AND POLICIES OF THE SYSTEM ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. CONCLUDES WITH A
REVIEW OF OTHER LAWS RELATED TO LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.
