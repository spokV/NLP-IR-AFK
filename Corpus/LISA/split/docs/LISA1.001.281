DEVELOPMENTS AT THE RUTHERFORD AND APPLETON LABORATORIES LIBRARY.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AT THE LIBRARY INCLUDE COM CATALOGUES, AND THE USE OF AERE
(HARWELL)'S TEXT RETRIEVAL SOFTWARE PACKAGE STATUS, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN SOME
DETAIL. STATUS WAS ALREADY ON SITE, SO (HOPEFULLY) NO OTHER COSTS WOULD BE
INCURRED, LOCAL EXPERTISE WITH PRIME HARDWARE WAS AVAILABLE, AND OTHER LIBRARY
SYSTEMS WERE ALREADY USING STATUS SO IT COULD BE ASSUMED THAT SOME OF THE
INITIAL PROBLEMS HAD ALREADY BEEN SOLVED ELSEWHERE.
