SELECTED ASPECTS FROM THE CHANGE OF GUIDELINES ON STOCK EXPANSION IN LIBRARIES
IN THE LEIPZIG AREA.
     
IN 1975 THE NUMBER OF STOCK ITEMS PER INHABITANT IN LEIPZIG LIBRARIES WAS
SLIGHTLY BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, SO PLANS FOR 1976-80 EMPHASISED STOCK
EXPANSION. VARIABLE PROVISION STANDARDS WERE CALCULATED FOR CENTRAL AND BRANCH
LIBRARIES. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF RESULTS FOR THIS PERIOD SHOWS A LARGE STOCK
BUDGET, SO THAT IN SEVERAL AREAS THE REQUIRED LEVELS OF STOCK PROVISION WERE
REACHED OR EVEN EXCEEDED. ONLY SOME OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED AREAS FELL
BELOW THE REQUISITE STANDARDS. OTHER AIMS FOR 1976-80 WERE THE EXPANSION AND
QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF STOCKS IN THE CENTRAL LIBRARY AND THE RAISING OF
PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES. PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY WAS EXPERIENCED WITH
STOCKS FOR RURAL LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY FOR PART-TIME BRANCH LIBRARIES;
GUIDELINES FOR 1981-85 AIM TO IMPROVE THIS ASPECT OF THE SERVICE.
