LITERATURE INFORMATION AND UAP. THE PRACTICE IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF
BULGARIA.

SINCE THE MID 70S THE TERM UAP (UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS) HAS
BEEN CURRENT IN LIBRARY WORK. LIBRARIANS HAVE DEVELOPED THE PROCESS OF MAKING
PUBLICATIONS AVAILABLE UNIVERSALLY ALONG VARIOUS LINES. IN BULGARIA THE
CONCEPT HAS BEEN TAKEN UP WITH MUCH INTEREST AND DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. UAP IS
TO DEVELOP ON 3 LEVELS' NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL. THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY IN SOFIA HAS DEVELOPED A CATALOGUE SYSTEM WHICH PRESENTS A CURRENT
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RECORD OF ALL NATIONAL PUBLICATIONS-THIS BULGARIAN NATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHY IS PUBLISHED IN 8 SERIES. IT ENABLES THE NATIONAL LIBRARY TO
SUPPLY LITERATURE ON BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE AVAILABILITY
OF FOREIGN LITERATURE IS IMPROVED BY LITERATURE INFORMATION SOURCES SUCH AS,
2THE CENTRAL CATALOGUE OF FOREIGN PERIODICALS1 AND 2THE BULLETIN OF FOREIGN
MONOGRAPHS1 BOTH OF WHICH ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN COMPUTERISED FORM.
