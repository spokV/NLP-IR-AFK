THE USSR MET TO DISCUSS CURRENT NATIONAL POLICIES ON THE PRESERVATION OF
NATIONAL LIBRARY COLLECTIONS AND METHODS OF CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF
BOOKS, PERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS. A RESOLUTION WAS ADOPTED TO INCREASE
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THESE FIELDS. IN PRACTICE THIS WILL MEAN HOLDING

TECHNOLOGY AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE COMECON. GREATER PARTICIPATION IN RELEVANT
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS, ESPECIALLY IFLA, IS ALSO IMPORTANT.
