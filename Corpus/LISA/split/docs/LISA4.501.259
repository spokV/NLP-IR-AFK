THESE NEEDS IMMEDIATELY BY PROVIDING SELECTED DOCUMENTS IN RESPONSE TO PATIENT
CARE QUERIES, TO BUILD MULTIDISCIPLINARY DOCUMENT COLLECTIONS RELATING TO
SPECIFIC PATIENT CARE PROBLEMS, AND TO MAKE THESE AVAILABLE TO OTHER HOSPITALS

DOCTORS. DISCUSSES WHY NOT ALL THESE AIMS COULD BE FULFILLED AND DESCRIBES
