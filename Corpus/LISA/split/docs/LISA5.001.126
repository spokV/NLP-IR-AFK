REGIONAL COOPERATION' SOME PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENTS.

PAPER PRESENTED TO A MEETING OF THE WORKING PARTY ON PROVINCIAL CENTRAL
LIBRARIES IN DEVENTER, 19 NOV 81. IN THE NETHERLANDS THE CUTBACKS IN LOCAL
GOVERNMENT FINANCES TOGETHER WITH THE GROWING DEMAND ON LIBRARIES FOR
TECHNICAL INFORMATION HAVE ENCOURAGED PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO COOPERATE WITH ONE
ANOTHER ON A REGIONAL BASIS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THEIR
SERVICES. IN ADDITION THE EXPECTATION THAT THE EXISTING NETWORK OF LIBRARIES
CHARGED WITH A REGIONAL SUPPORT FUNCTION WILL BE INCREASED, AND THE
DECENTRALISATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES AS PROPOSED IN THE NEW PUBLIC
SERVICES ACT, WILL FURTHER ENCOURAGE THIS TREND. HOWEVER, WHERE LIBRARIES
ENTER INTO SCHEMES OF COOPERATION THE NEEDS OF THEIR READERS SHOULD REMAIN THE
PRIME CONSIDERATION.
