THE LIBRARIAN'S LIFE, SCHOLARSHIP AND LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
(THE JANET DOE LECTURE ON THE HISTORY OR PHILOSOPHY OF MEDICAL LIBRARIANSHIP,
PRESENTED JUNE 17, 1980 AT THE 80TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, D.C.) IF LIBRARIANS ARE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLE AND
PARTICIPATE IN THE LIFE OF SCHOLARSHIP, THEY MUST BE MORE THAN RECORD
CUSTODIANS OR INFORMATION SERVICE MANAGERS. THERE ARE MANY APPROACHES TO THIS
UNDERSTANDING INCLUDING THE HISTORICAL, SOCIAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND
EPISTEMOLOGICAL. IT CAN ALSO BE SOUGHT THROUGH A STUDY OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF
KNOWLEDGE AND A STUDY OF THE WAYS IN WHICH CHANGES IN COMMUNICATIONS
TECHNOLOGY IN WRITING AND PRINTING HAVE AFFECTED SCHOLARSHIP IN THE PAST. THIS
MAY ALSO PROVIDE A MEANS OF PREPARING FOR THE IMPACT OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ON
THE SCHOLARSHIP OF THE FUTURE.
