VITAL NEEDS OF LIBRARIES.

FOR YEARS NOW LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN BULGARIA HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE
EXAMPLE OF THEIR SOVIET COUNTERPARTS IN THE ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES. TARGETS FOR BULGARIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH, TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCEMENT AND THE POPULATION'S HIGHER LIVING STANDARD IN THE 1980S MAKE THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF SOVIET LITERATURE AND PERIODICALS STILL MORE OBVIOUS.
CONCENTRATING UPON CONCRETE TASKS AND PROBLEMS IN THEIR AREA, LIBRARIANS MUST
SUPPLY THEIR READERS AND OTHERS WORKING IN LOCAL INDUSTRIES, RESEARCH
INSTITUTES, SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WITH RELEVANT INFORMATION. SOVIET SOURCES,
SUCH AS TECHNICAL PERIODICALS HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN THE PAST AND WILL
CONTINUE TO BE IN THE FUTURE. LIBRARIANS CAN RELY UPON ASSISTANCE GIVEN BY THE
STAFF AT THE HOUSE OF SOVIET SCIENCE AND CULTURE IN SOFIA. PARTNERSHIPS WITH
SOVIET LIBRARIES HAVE ALSO PROVEN VALUABLE. SOME VENTURES FROM THE PLEVEN
REGION (NORTHERN BULGARIA) ARE GIVEN AS EXAMPLES OF SUCCESSFUL PROMOTION OF
SOVI ET LITERATURE AND EXPERIENCE IN LIBRARIANSHIP AMONG THE BULGARIAN PUBLIC.
