CITATION ANALYSIS AND BIBLIOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CORE PERIODICALS.

A REPORT OF THE PRELIMINARY STAGES OF A SPANISH STATE SPONSORED RESEARCH
PROJECT. THE ANALYSIS COVERS CITATIONS OF PAPERS ON ANTINEOPLASTIC SUBSTANCES
IN 2CANCER RESEARCH1 FROM 1976-79. A TOTAL OF 7,815 REFERENCES TO 576
PERIODICALS CARRIED IN 284 PAPERS WAS OBTAINED, AND THE BRADFORD TECHNIQUE
APPLIED TO ASCERTAIN THE CORE PERIODICALS RECEIVING AN AVERAGE OF 1 CITATION
PER MONTH. A COMPARISON WAS THEN MADE BETWEEN CORE AND NON-CORE PERIODICAL
THEMATIC COVERAGE OF 8 ANTINEOPLASTIC SUBSTANCES; AND THE QUANTITATIVE
DIFFERENCE IN DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE 2 SETS OF PERIODICALS FOR GENERAL AND
SPECIFIC THEMATIC DISTRIBUTION ESTABLISHED. FULL DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF ALL
CALCULATIONS MADE, AND RESULTS TABULATED. THE RESULTS OBTAINED SHOW THAT ONLY
THE CORE PERIODICALS CAN SATISFY THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE FIELD,
AS REGARDS THEMATIC COVERAGE AND CITATION FREQUENCY.
