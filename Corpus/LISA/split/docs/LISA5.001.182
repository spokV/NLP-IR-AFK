PRESS DOCUMENTATION AND MICROGRAPHY.

DISCUSSES HOW MICROGRAPHY CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE ORGANISATION, MANAGEMENT AND
OPERATION OF DOCUMENTATION CENTRES USING PRESS MATERIAL. A WIDE VARIETY OF
POTENTIAL USERS EXISTS FOR ARCHIVES BASED ON NEWSPAPERS, AND WHILE SUCH
CENTRES HAVE PROBLEMS IN COMMON CAUSED BY THE NATURE OF SUCH MATERIALS, EACH
HAS REQUIREMENTS OF ITS OWN DICTATED BY ITS OWN SPECIAL FUNCTIONS. GENERAL
TOPICS ONLY ARE CONSIDERED HERE' THE POSSIBILITIES OF MICROGRAPHY IN
CONSERVATION AND STORAGE, AND HOW MICROFORMS CAN BE USED IN DISSEMINATING
INFORMATION EITHER IN THE FORM OF PRESS DOSSIERS OR DATA BANKS. IN CONCLUSION,
DISCUSSES COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS AS THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO EXPANDING THE USE OF
MICROGRAPHY IN THIS FIELD.
