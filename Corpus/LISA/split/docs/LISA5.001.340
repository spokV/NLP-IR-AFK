FROM TELECAT/UNICAT TO RIBLIN OR THE TRANSMODIFICATION OF A NETWORK.

AN ACCOUNT OF HOW THE NEW CANADIAN LIBRARY NETWORK RIBLIN DEVELOPED FROM THE
DISBANDED TELECAT/UNICAT COOPERATIVE, MAINTAINING CONTINUITY OF SERVICE TO
MEMBERS BY USING THE SAME BIBLIOGRAPHIC UTILITY, UTLAS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF
THE ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF THE ORIGINAL GROUP, AND SERVICES PROVIDED.
THE EXPANDED SERVICES OFFERED BY THE NEW NETWORK ARE OUTLINED TO SHOW ITS
SUPERIORITY IN CATERING MORE EFFICIENTLY FOR A COMPARATIVELY RESTRICTED GROUP
OF USERS. THE DISSOLUTION OF TELECAT/UNICAT IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY
OF PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES FOR A WIDELY HETEROGENEOUS USER GROUP.
