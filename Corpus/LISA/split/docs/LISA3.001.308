THE PROVISION OF LITERATURE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND TRADE UNION LIBRARIES.
     
IN EAST GERMANY, AN IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIP HAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND
THE ZENTRALINSTITUT FUR BIBLIOTHEKSWESEN (ZIB-CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF
LIBRARIANSHIP), WHICH PROVIDES INFORMATION ON PUBLISHED LITERATURE. PRESENT
PROBLEMS INCLUDE OUT OF PRINT MATERIAL AND THE INABILITY OF LOCAL BOOKSELLERS
TO PROVIDE ALL REQUIREMENTS. IT IS ASSUMED THAT ALL LIBRARIES BUY THE POPULAR
MATERIAL RECOMMENDED BY ZIB, ALTHOUGH ONLY LARGE LIBRARIES BUY THE MORE
ADVANCED WORKS, ESPECIALLY ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. AN AGREEMENT HAS BEEN
MADE BETWEEN PUBLISHERS AND ZIB CONCERNING THE CENTRALISING OF LIBRARY
SUPPLIES. ZIB'S LISTS OF RECOMMENDED BOOKS, PERIODICALS, NEWSPAPERS, TAPES AND
RECORDS ARE AN IMPORTANT BASIS FOR PURCHASING POLICY; EACH LIBRARY SHOULD HAVE
1 STAFF MEMBER RESPONSIBLE FOR DEALING WITH THEM.
