PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' THE AMERICAN AUTHOR'S VIEWPOINT.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). PLR FACES
OBSTACLES THAT MAY WELL KEEP IT FROM US SHORES FOR A LONG TIME. A SAMPLING OF
US AUTHORS INDICATES THAT THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THIS, BUT HARBOUR AN
ATTRACTION TO PLR THAT MAY BLOSSOM INTO THE KIND OF SUPPORT THE CONCEPT HAS
FOUND ELSEWHERE. THIS MAY GIVE PLR A RING OF INEVITABILITY.
