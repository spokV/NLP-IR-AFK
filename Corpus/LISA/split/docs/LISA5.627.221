MODELING COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT BEHAVIOUR' A PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.

DESCRIBES A MODEL FOR COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WITHIN BOTH
SPECIFIC COLLECTIONS AND LIBRARY SYSTEMS AS A WHOLE AND SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE
THE FULL RANGE AND COMPLEXITY OF RELEVANT FACTORS. ALTHOUGH THE MODEL
PRESENTED IS NOT NOW QUANTIFIABLE IN ALL ITS DIMENSIONS, ITS ANALYSIS IS SEEN
AS LEADING TOWARDS BETTER MODELS FOR COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IN TURN
WILL ALLOW MORE USEFUL PLANS AND PROJECTIONS.
