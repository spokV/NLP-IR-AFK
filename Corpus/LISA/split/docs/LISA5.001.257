SOME THOUGHTS IN THE FORM OF A DIARY.

PRESENTS PERSONAL VIEWS ON RECENT PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES. WITH REFERENCE TO A
STUDY DAY ON 'SHOCKING BOOKS', CRITICISES THE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION CHOSEN,
A QUESTIONNAIRE ON 25 SELECTED TITLES DISTRIBUTED TO LIBRARIANS, AS AMBIGUOUS,
AND PROPOSES INSTEAD THAT USER RESPONSES TO A LESS RESTRICTED SELECTION OF
BOOKS BE INVESTIGATED. SECONDLY DISCUSSES THE PLACE OF CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN RELATION TO A STUDY DAY ON THIS THEME, ARGUING THAT THE
LIBRARY'S PRIORITY IS TO PROVIDE SATISFACTORY DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION
SERVICES; OTHER ACTIVITIES ARE ONLY OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE, AND SHOULD BE
CONSIDERED AS PUBLICITY STRATEGIES RATHER THAN ACTUAL USER SERVICES.
