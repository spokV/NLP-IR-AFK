WHY PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOULD BE FREE.

REPORT BY THE FREEMANTLE CITY COUNCIL URGING THE CONTINUATION OF A FREE PUBLIC
LIBRARY SERVICE, IN THE FACE OF SUGGESTIONS BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
ASSOCIATION THAT CHARGES BE LEVIED FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE. THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY IS OF REAL VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY, AND AN INFORMED CITIZENRY IS
CONSIDERED VITAL TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS; INFORMATION IS NECESSARY IN
EDUCATION AND RECREATION. SUGGESTS THE NEED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE
COORDINATED STATEWIDE LIBRARY SYSTEM IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA TO AID SERVICES IN
TERMS OF STOCK, ECONOMICS, AND MANPOWER.
