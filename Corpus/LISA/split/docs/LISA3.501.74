AN ACTIVE FACTOR IN THE PROGRESS/DEVELOPMENT OF THE BULGARIAN NATION.
     
WHEN INTERVIEWED ABOUT ACHIEVEMENTS, PRIORITIES AND PROBLEMS OF THE CYRIL AND
METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA, ITS DIRECTOR EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF
INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH BOOKS, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY, FOR THE COUNTRY'S PROGRESS. ALTHOUGH THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF A
SMALL COUNTRY LIKE BULGARIA ARE ALMOST THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE LARGE COUNTRY,
THE FORMER MUST BE MUCH MORE SELECTIVE AND CAREFULLY BUDGETED BECAUSE OF ITS
LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES IN GENERAL, AND PARTICULARLY IN FOREIGN
CURRENCIES. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY'S BOOK COLLECTION IS IN FACT, OPEN TO THE
WHOLE COUNTRY BY MEANS OF INTERLENDING. IT HAS THE MAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR
PUBLISHING THE BULGARIAN NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, COMPUTERISATION OF WHICH HAS
GRADUALLY BEEN INTRODUCED. EXTENSION OF THE PRESENT BUILDING, CONSTRUCTION OF
A DEPOSITORY LIBRARY TOGETHER WITH OVERALL NEW INVESTMENT WILL ALLOW THE
LIBRARY TO MEET THE INCR EASING DEMANDS ON ITS SERVICES AND HELP TO MAINTAIN
STANDARDS.
