LIBRARY NETWORKING IN AUSTRALIA' THE PAST IS FUTURE.

TAKES A CRITICAL LOOK AT PROPOSALS BY THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA TO
PRODUCE A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY NETWORK (ABN). THE LICENCE FOR A SOFTWARE
PACKAGE, DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED AT THE WASHINGTON STATE LIBRARY, KNOWN AS
THE WASHINGTON LIBRARY NETWORK, WAS ACQUIRED IN 1980 AFTER CONSIDERABLE
TESTING. PUTS THE PROPOSALS IN THE BROADER CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY ARE SET. THEY
SYSTEM HAS 4 MAIN COMPONENTS' ON-LINE UNION CATALOGUE; ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
SOURCE FILE; CATALOGUE PROCESSING; AND CATALOGUE PRODUCTION. CONCLUDES THAT

A PROCESSING CAPABILITY WHICH IS ALREADY AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE AT A LOWER COST.
