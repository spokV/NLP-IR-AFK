THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION SERVICE IN THE YAKUTS ASSR.

THE YAKUT CENTRE FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND PROPAGANDA
PROVIDES, IN COOPERATION WITH THE YAKUT RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR AGRICULTURE, A
VALUABLE INFORMATION SERVICE WITHIN THE YAKUT SOCIALIST REPUBLIC, WITH
EMPHASIS ON DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ON INNOVATIONS. THE VALUE OF THE
INFORMATION SERVICE CAN BE DEMONSTRATED BY THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES' THE
APPLICATION OF INNOVATIONS BY VETERINARY SERVICES RESULTED IN A CONSIDERABLE
DECREASE OF BRUCELLOSIS (A SAVING OF 7.5 MILLION ROUBLES); THE APPLICATION OF
INNOVATIONS BY COLLECTIVE FARMS RESULTED IN A SAVING OF 14.7 MILLION ROUBLES.
