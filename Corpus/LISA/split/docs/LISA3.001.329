A NATIONAL LENDING LIBRARY FOR AUSTRALIA.
     
PRESENTS A MODEL FOR THE FUTURE SUPPLY OF INTERLOANS IN AUSTRALIA. PROPOSES A
NATIONAL LOAN/PHOTOCOPY COLLECTION AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA
(N.L.A.) FOR CURRENT JOURNALS, SUPPORTED BY A HIGHLY SELECTIVE UNION LIST.
ACCESS TO LOCATIONS FOR DEAD TITLES AND LAST RUNS WOULD BE THROUGH A LESS
VOLATILE UNION CATALOGUE COVERING 60-70 LIBRARIES. REPORTS WOULD BE SUPPLIED
FROM A SINGLE CENTRE FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY. LIKEWISE, CENTRAL PROVISION FOR
BOOKS WOULD BE MADE BY THE N.L.A., SUPPORTED BY A UNION CATALOGUE COVERING
THOSE LIBRARIES WITH SIGNIFICANT UNIQUE HOLDINGS AND INTAKE.
