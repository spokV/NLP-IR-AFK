REPRESENTATION OF CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS FROM A LARGE TIME-ORIENTED CLINICAL
DATABASE' THE RX PROJECT.

CLINICS. MEDICAL DATA IS NEEDED NOT ONLY BY PRACTITIONERS BUT BY HOSPITAL
ADMINISTRATORS, HEALTH INSURERS, REGULATORY AGENCIES, AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL

POTENTIAL VALUE FOR EPIDEMIOLOGIC RESEARCH, FOR POST-MARKETING DRUG
SURVEILLANCE, FOR EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF COSTS AND BENEFITS OF NEW TESTS AND
THERAPY PROGRAMMES, AND FOR ASSESSMENT OF LONG-TERM OUTCOME IN CHRONIC
DISEASES.
