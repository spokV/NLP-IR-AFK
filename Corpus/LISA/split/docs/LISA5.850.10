INTERLIBRARY LENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS.

INTERLENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS IS BASED ON A NATIONAL SYSTEM FOR THE SUPPLY
OF SCHOLARLY LITERATURE AND A REGIONAL SYSTEM FOR SUPPLYING A WIDER RANGE OF
MATERIAL MAINLY BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. 725,000 REQUESTS WERE MADE IN 1979.
MOST REQUESTS ARE SATISFIED THROUGH UNION CATALOGUES OR PRINTED UNION LISTS.
IN ADDITION TO THE 12 PROVINCIAL CENTRES, THE 13 REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARIES
HAVE A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE REGIONAL SUPPLY SYSTEM; THEY RECEIVED 131,708
REQUESTS IN 1980 AND SATISFIED 27%. A SINGLE CENTRE IN EACH REGION IS
RECOMMENDED. A SURVEY OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM SHOWED THAT 40% OF ALL REQUESTS
AT THIS LEVEL CAME FROM ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, 40% FROM SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND 20%
FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. MOST REQUESTS ARE FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (60%), FOR
ENGLISH LANGUAGE MATERIAL (55% OF ALL REQUESTS; 70% OF REQUESTS FOR JOURNALS),
AND FOR MORE RECENT MATERIAL (65% PUBLISHED IN THE LAST 10 YEARS). THE
SATISFACTION RATE WAS 76% (HIGHER FOR REQ UESTS SENT TO UNION CATALOGUES): 1/2
WERE SUPPLIED IN 2 WEEKS, 2/3 IN 3 WEEKS IMPORTANT GAPS IN JOURNAL COVERAGE
WERE IDENTIFIED. AN ON-LINE NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN 1984
AND WILL BE USED TO DISTRIBUTE REQUESTS MORE EVENLY BETWEEN LIBRARIES, BUT
SPECIFIC GRANTS TO SUPPORT THE INTERLENDING FUNCTION IN MAJOR SUPPLYING
LIBRARIES WILL STILL BE NECESSARY, AND CHARGES SHOULD BE MADE. IMPROVED UNION
CATALOGUES ARE ENVISAGED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL ALSO.
