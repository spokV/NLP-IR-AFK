INFORMATION FLOW AND ANALYSIS' THEORY, SIMULATION, AND EXPERIMENTS. 1. BASIC
THEORETICAL AND CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT.

THIS SERIES OF ARTICLES DESCRIBES RESEARCH WHICH HAS BEEN UNDERWAY AT THE OHIO
STATE UNIVERSITY IN AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP A FUNDAMENTAL AND GENERAL THEORY OF
INFORMATION FLOW AND ANALYSIS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE RESEARCH ATTEMPTS TO (1)
IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY IMPORTANT VARIABLES AND PARAMETERS IN THE INFORMATION
FLOW PROCESS; (2) ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THESE VARIABLES; (3) APPLY THE
THEORY TO PRACTICAL SITUATIONS AND TO EXAMINE THE RESULTING IMPLICATIONS; AND
(4) DEVELOP MODELS, BOTH SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL, TO UTILISE AND VALIDATE
THE THEORY.
