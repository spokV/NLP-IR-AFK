A STATE TRANSITION ANALYSIS OF ONLINE INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF ON-LINE SEARCHING PATTERNS COMPARED THE USAGE OF A
QUERY LANGUAGE BY VARIOUS GROUPS OF SEARCHERS. DATA WERE GATHERED BY AN
EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT, INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION FOR DATA ACCESS (IIDA),
CONCERNED WITH DEVELOPING AND TESTING A SYSTEM WHICH SERVES AS A TEACHER AND
ASSISTANT TO USERS OF LOCKHEED'S DIALOG SYSTEM. SEQUENTIAL LISTINGS OF USER
COMMANDS WERE CLASSIFIED BY CORRESPONDING STATE CODES TO REPRESENT PHASES OF
SEARCHING. ZERO- THROUGH 4TH-ORDER MARKOVIAN ANALYSES OF INDIVIDUAL COMMANDS
AND STRINGS OF LIKE COMMANDS WERE PERFORMED TO COMPARE SEARCHING PROCEDURES
USED BY 3 CLASSES OF USERS.
