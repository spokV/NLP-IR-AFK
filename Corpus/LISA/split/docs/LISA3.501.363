A SUBJECT ACCESS PROJECT (SAP)-A NEW TEST DATABASE FOR ESA-QUEST.
     
WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SUBJECT ACCESS PROJECT, A NEW VERSION OF
ON-LINE-CATALOGUE FOR MONOGRAPHIC PUBLICATIONS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. IT IS AN
EFFECTIVE AID FOR SEARCHES BY SUBJECT AS WELL AS BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA. THE IDEA
OF SAP IS TO PRODUCE SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS OF BOOKS TAKEN FROM THE BOOKS
THEMSELVES AND TO MAKE MORE USE OF THE INHERENT ATTRIBUTES OF A PUBLICATION.
TO MAKE POSSIBLE A DEEPER ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF SAP-INDEXING TECHNIQUE
THE DATA BASE HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO ESA-QUEST AS A TEST FILE.
