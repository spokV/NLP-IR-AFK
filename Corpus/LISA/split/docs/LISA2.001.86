SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRES' POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS, AS EXEMPLIFIED BY A
SCHOOL IN PFULLINGEN.

PRINTED WORKS, WHICH MAY EXPLAIN WHY SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE ONLY SPORADICALLY
USED AS A BASE FOR TEACHING. DEMONSTRATES THE REQUIREMENTS, POSSIBILITIES AND
LIMITATIONS OF THE INCORPORATION OF MEDIA CENTRES IN THE LEARNING PROCESSES IN
A SCHOOL SETTING, USING A SCHOOL IN PFULLINGEN AS A CASE STUDY. SHOWS THAT THE
MEDIA CENTRE IS AFFECTED STRONGLY BY THE GENERAL UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE
USE OF MEDIA IN SCHOOLS.
