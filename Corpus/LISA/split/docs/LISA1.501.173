EMPLOYEE MOTIVATION' EXPECTANCY THEORY AT WORK.
     
EXPECTANCY THEORIES OF EMPLOYEE MOTIVATION HAVE BEEN THE FOCUS OF MUCH
EMPIRICAL RESEARCH AND THEORETICAL WRITING. LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN,
HOWEVER, TO ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN THE WORKPLACE. SUGGESTS THAT THIS MAY
BE BECAUSE THE MODEL, AS USUALLY DISCUSSED, IS HIGHLY COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO
UNDERSTAND. TRANSLATES EXPECTANCY THEORY INTO A FORM THAT IS BOTH
UNDERSTANDABLE AND USABLE BY LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS.
