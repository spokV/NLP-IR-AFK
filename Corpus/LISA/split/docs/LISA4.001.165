THE FACTS ABOUT CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
IN THE 1978/79 ACADEMIC YEAR STUDENTS OF THE FREDERIK MULLER SCHOOL OF
LIBRARIANSHIP CARRIED OUT A SURVEY INTO CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE
NETHERLANDS. 15 LIBRARIES, VARYING IN SIZE FROM SMALL TOWN TO LARGE CITY
LIBRARIES, WERE SELECTED, 5 IN AREAS WITH A STRONG PROTESTANT LEANING, 5 IN
ROMAN CATHOLIC AREAS AND 5 IN AREAS WITH NO STRONG RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS. THE
RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF CONTROVERSIAL BOOKS STOCKED BY LIBRARIES WAS
IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE SIZE OF THE LIBRARY. IN ADDITION, DESPITE THE
ASSURANCES OF ALL LIBRARIANS THAT NO FORM OF CENSORSHIP WAS PRACTISED, FEWER
BOOKS OF A POLITICALLY-CONTROVERSIAL OR PORNOGRAPHIC NATURE WERE TO BE FOUND
IN LIBRARIES IN RELIGIOUS AREAS. IT IS CLEAR THAT CENSORSHIP IS STILL ALIVE IN
THE NETHERLANDS IN 1981 UNDER THE GUISE OF 'REJECTION ON ETHICAL GROUNDS'.
