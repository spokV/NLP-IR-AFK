WORD PROCESSING OUTPUT MICROFORM: AFTER COM CAN WORD
PROCESSOR/MICRO-/MINI-COMPUTER OUTPUT MICROFORM TAKE OFF?.
     
DESCRIBES THE BENEFITS TO BE HAD BY PRODUCING MICROFORMS DIRECT FROM WORD
PROCESSOR OR MINI/MICRO-COMPUTER OUTPUT WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY PAPER
INTERMEDIARY. HOWEVER, WHILE COM RECORDERS CAN ACCEPT THE MAGNETIC TAPE OUTPUT
OF MOST MAINFRAME COMPUTERS, FEW COM RECORDERS CAN ACCEPT FLOPPY DISCS DIRECT
AND THOSE THAT CAN WILL ONLY ACCEPT IBM FORMATTED FLOPPY DISCS. THE ARTICLE
GOES ON TO REVIEW THE VARIOUS METHODS THAT ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED TO PRODUCE
WORD PROCESSING OUTPUT MICROFORM AND DESCRIBES THE WORK THAT NRCD IS DOING IN
THIS AREA.
