THEORY OF CORRELATION TABLES. 2.

A PROCESS HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR THE OPTIMISATION OF SPECTROSCOPICAL CORRELATION
TABLES CONTAINING COMPLEX PRIMARY AND SUBFRAGMENTS. THE METHOD IS BASED ON
INFORMATION THEORY AND PROVIDES THE QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF THE USEFULNESS
OF ANY CHANGE WITHIN A GIVEN CORRELATION TABLE. IN THIS WAY, FOR EXAMPLE, IT
SHOWS IN WHICH CASE IT IS EXPEDIENT TO SPECIALISE A FRAGMENT AND ALSO WHEN IT
IS WORTH DRAWING TOGETHER SEVERAL SUBFRAGMENTS INTO ONE FRAGMENT. THE PROCESS
CAN EASILY BE EXPRESSED AS A COMPUTER ALGORITHM, AND IN THIS WAY IT CAN BE
USEFUL FOR A SET OF COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS FOR SPECTRUM ANALYSIS.
