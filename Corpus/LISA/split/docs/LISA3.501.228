RENOVATION OF A PROTECTED BUILDING IN SAYNATSALO.
     
SAYNATSALO MAIN LIBRARY FORMS A PART OF THE LOCAL TOWN HALL DESIGNED BY ALVAR
AALTO 30 YEARS AGO. THE BUILDING IS PROTECTED. THE RENOVATION HAD TO BE
CARRIED OUT ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE MUSEUM OFFICE. CONSEQUENTLY
COMPROMISES HAD TO BE MADE. SOME SOLUTIONS WERE EXPENSIVE. THE LIBRARY IS ON 2
FLOORS BUT NO LIFTS COULD BE INSTALLED. THE MUSEUM OFFICE STIPULATED THAT ALL
FURNITURE AND ACCESSORIES MUST BE REPLACED BY AALTO FURNITURE, SOME OF WHICH
HAD TO BE SPECIALLY MADE FOR THE LIBRARY BUILDING.
