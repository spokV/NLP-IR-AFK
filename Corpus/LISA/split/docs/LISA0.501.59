THE WORK WITH STOCK IN A SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARY OF AN INDUSTRIAL
CORPORATION.

THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARY OF THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OF THE
ALEKSANDRIYAUGOL' CORPORATION WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1960. THE MAIN TASK OF THE

AND POLITICAL AWARENESS. THE LIBRARY, WITH A STAFF OF 2 SERVES 1,100 USERS.
THE USER GROUP INCLUDES WORKERS ATTENDING THE COURSES ORGANISED BY THE
EDUCATION DEPARTMENT, LECTURERS AS WELL AS THE STAFF OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF
THE CORPORATION WHICH DO NOT HAVE A LIBRARY. THE MANAGEMENT OF THE STOCK OF
THE LIBRARY (35,000 ITEMS) IS DISCUSSED WITH EMPHASIS ON PLANNING AND
