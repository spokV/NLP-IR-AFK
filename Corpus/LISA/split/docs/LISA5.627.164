TEACHING TECHNIQUES FOR THE USE OF LIBRARIES.

SCHOOL CHILDREN NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE LIBRARIES AND WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN A
LIBRARY. SURVEYS WERE CARRIED OUT TO FIND OUT WHAT LITERATURE CHILDREN READ.
BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THESE SURVEYS A COURSE FOR TEACHING CHILDREN
TECHNIQUES FOR THE USE OF LIBRARIES WAS DEVELOPED. THE COURSE CONSISTED OF
CLASSWORK' ANALYSING FAVOURITE BOOKS, DISCOVERING THE CONTENTS LIST, PREFACE,
TITLE, PUBLISHER ETC. AND VISITS TO LIBRARIES. DURING LIBRARY VISITS THE
CHILDREN WORKED IN GROUPS WITH GIVEN TASKS. THROUGH ASKING LIBRARIANS AND
OTHERS THEY WERE TO DISCOVER VARIOUS MEANS OF FINDING BOOKS. THEY WERE ALSO
ENCOURAGED TO FIND OUT HOW A LIBRARY IS ORGANISED, WHAT LENDING CONDITIONS ARE
AND WHAT TRAINING A LIBRARIAN NEEDS. THE GROUPS COMPARED THEIR RESULTS IN
CLASSWORK.
