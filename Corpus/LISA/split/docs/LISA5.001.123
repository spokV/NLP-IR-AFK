A GLOOMY OUTLOOK FOR LIBRARIES?.

PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAS HALTED AT A POINT WHEN, BECAUSE OF THE
RECESSION, LIBRARY SERVICES ARE PARTICULARLY NECESSARY. CURRENT ECONOMIC
MEASURES HAVE HIT LIBRARIES HARD. SOME PEOPLE NOW REGARD INFORMATION AS
MERCHANDISE FOR WHICH A SUITABLE MARKET PRICE MUST BE OBTAINED; THIS INCREASES
THE RISK OF INFORMATION SERVICES BEING TAKEN OVER BY PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH
COULD LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN STATE BUDGETS. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THREATENS TO BYPASS THE LIBRARY SERVICE AND BECAUSE OF
THE COMPETITIVE SITUATION ON THE INFORMATION MARKET LIBRARIES ARE BEING ASKED
TO RESTRICT THEMSELVES TO THEIR TRADITIONAL TASKS. LIBRARIES MUST MOBILISE
RESERVES HITHERTO UNUSED; REFUSING TO IMPLEMENT NEW METHODS OF LITERATURE
PROVISION COULD HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES. INITIAL ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEMS
CAN BE OVERCOME THROUGH RATIONALISATION, CENTRALISATION AND WIDER USE OF
ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING.
