URGENT MEASURES FOR IMPROVING LOCATION REFERENCES OF PERIODICAL ARTICLES BY
WAY OF THE PERIODICAL DATA BANK.
     
THE NATIONAL REFERENCE SYSTEM FOR PERIODICALS AND SERIALS IS THE PERIODICAL
DATA BANK AT THE GERMAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE AND THE STATE LIBRARY OF PRUSSIAN
CULTURAL HERITAGE IN BERLIN. THE DATA BANK CONTAINS TITLE DATA ON 180,000
GERMAN AND FOREIGN PERIODICAL ARTICLES WITH 500,000 LOCATION REFERENCES. TO
IMPROVE THE SUPPLY OF PERIODICAL ARTICLES OVER THE SHORT TERM THE FOLLOWING
MEASURES ARE NECESSARY' THE ACCELERATION OF CATALOGUING OF ALL PERIODICAL
COLLECTIONS IN ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES INVOLVED IN THE NATIONAL LITERATURE
SUPPLY SYSTEM; THE DATA COLLECTIONS OF OTHER PERIODICAL REFERENCE SYSTEMS
SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DATA BANK; TITLE DATA IN THE PERIODICAL DATA BANK
SHOULD BE COMPARED WITH THAT SUPPLIED BY SUBJECT INFORMATION SERVICES WITH A
VIEW TO ACQUIRING MISSING TITLES; THE DATA BANK SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED IN AN
ON-LINE INFORMATION BANK. AN EFFICIENT ON-LINE SYSTEM WOULD EVENT UALLY LEAD
TO USERS BEING ABLE TO ORDER PERIODICALS DIRECTLY AND BEING REFERRED TO THE
NEAREST RELEVANT LIBRARY.
