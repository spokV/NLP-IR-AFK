THE NEED FOR TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN LIBRARIES.

THE WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIANS RESPOND TO THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL DETERMINE, IN
PART, THE LIBRARY'S PLACE IN THE CULTURE OF THE YEARS TO COME. A METHOD CALLED
TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT WILL AID LIBRARIANS IN THIS AREA. THE METHOD CONSISTS OF
7 STEPS' (1) DEFINE THE TASK OF THE ASSESSMENT; (2) DESCRIBE THE NEW HARDWARE
IN DEPTH; (3) DEVELOP THE STATE-OF-THE-LIBRARY ASSUMPTIONS; (4) IDENTIFY
IMPACT AREAS AND EFFECTS OF THE NEW DEVICE; (5) MAKE A PRELIMINARY IMPACT
ANALYSIS; (6) IDENTIFY POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES; (7) COMPLETE THE IMPACT
ANALYSIS.
