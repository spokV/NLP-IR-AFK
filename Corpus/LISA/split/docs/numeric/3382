SYSTEMATIC INDEXING OF THE 2UNION CATALOGUE OF AUSTRIAN THESES1.
     
THE 2UNION CATALOGUE OF AUSTRIAN THESES1 APPEARS ANNUALLY AND LISTS ALL
APPROVED THESES FROM AUSTRIAN UNIVERSITIES AND POLYTECHNICS. SINCE ITS
INCEPTION IN 1966 UNTIL 1975 THE SUBJECT INDEX WAS CONSTRUCTED FROM KEYWORDS
IN THE TITLES, BUT AS FROM 1976 A SPECIALLY DESIGNED SYSTEMATIC SUBJECT
CLASSIFICATION HAS BEEN IN USE. IT IS TO SOME EXTENT BASED UPON THAT IN USE AT
VIENNA'S UNIVERSITY AND POLYTECHNIC, AND THE NEW METHOD OF SELECTING AND
STANDARDISING SUBJECT HEADINGS IS DESCRIBED. THERE ARE ALSO INDEXES OF
PERSONAL NAMES (AS SUBJECTS OF THESES, NOT AUTHORS), AND PLACE NAMES. INDEXING
IS DONE MANUALLY, COMPUTERISED INDEXING BEING TOO EXPENSIVE. CUMULATIONS WILL
BE MADE, THE 1ST FOR THE PERIOD 1976-86.
