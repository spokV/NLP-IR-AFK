LITTLE MAGAZINES-AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.

LITTLE MAGAZINES PRESENT UNIQUE PROBLEMS, DUE MAINLY TO THE DIFFICULTY OF
BIBLIOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION AND THEIR UNCERTAIN LIVES. THEY ARE IMPORTANT
SOURCES OF LITERATURE, HOWEVER. AN EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO COLLECT THEM,
EARMARK FUNDS FOR CERTAIN TITLES (PERHAPS BEGINNING WITH A RETROSPECTIVE
COLLECTION), AND COOPERATE WITH OTHER LIBRARIES IN THEIR ACQUISITION.
