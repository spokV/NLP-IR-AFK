BOOK CLUBS AND AUTHORS' ROYALTIES.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS BOOKCLUBS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SEVERELY CRITICISED BY AUTHORS
FOR PAYING MUCH SMALLER ROYALTIES THAN THE NORMAL BOOKTRADE. THE 1ST BOOKCLUB
IN THE NETHERLANDS WAS FOUNDED IN 1937 AND THERE ARE NOW 6 REGISTERED CLUBS
WITH A TOTAL MEMBERSHIP OF APPROX. 1 1/2 MILLION MEMBERS. THE MARKET SHARE OF
THE BOOKCLUBS IN THE NETHERLANDS HAS RISEN FROM 2% IN 1966 TO 24% IN 1980. THE
REMOVAL OF THE COLLECTIVE PRICE AGREEMENT ON BOOKS WOULD ALSO BE DISASTROUS
FOR THE SMALLER BOOKSHOPS AND PUBLISHERS AND FOR LESSER-KNOWN AUTHORS.
BOOKSELLERS AND PUBLISHERS MUST NOW COME TO A TRADING ARRANGEMENT WITH THE
BOOKCLUBS. IT IS, HOWEVER, FORTUNATE THAT THE LARGER BOOKCLUBS ARE THEMSELVES
PART OF THE PUBLISHING TRADE.
