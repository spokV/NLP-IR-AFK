THIS IS THE WAY RUC HAS ORGANISED RECORDING OF TV.
     
DESCRIBES ROSKILDE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S VIDEOTAPE COLLECTION. SOME RECORDINGS
WERE MADE FROM THE START OF THE LIBRARY IN 1971, BUT THEY WERE USUALLY
DELETED. GRANTS FOR MODERN VIDEO-CASSETTE RECORDERS IN 1973 AND THE NEW
COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1977 MAKING IT LEGAL TO RECORD RADIO AND TV PROGRAMMES FOR
EDUCATIONAL USE ENABLED THE LIBRARY TO ORGANISE RECORDING AND USE IN A SYSTEM
PARALLEL TO THAT FOR BOOKS. DISCUSSES THE LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF WHO MAY
RECORD, WHAT MAY BE RECORDED, RESPONSIBILITY FOR POSSIBLE COMPENSATION, FREE
RIGHT TO LEND, DUTY TO DELETE. ARGUES THAT NOW THAT THE LEGAL QUESTION IS
CLEARED UP, PUBLIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES SHOULD ORGANISE A SYSTEM FOR
ACQUISITION, REGISTRATION, CATALOGUING AND LENDING OF RECORDINGS SIMILAR TO
THAT FOR BOOKS. DESCRIBES ROSKILDE'S SOLUTION. ORDERS FOR RECORDING OF DANISH
AND SWEDISH TV PROGRAMMES ARE RECEIVED FROM STAFF AND STUDENTS AND SOME
RECORDING IS DONE ON THE LIBRARY'S OWN INITIATIVE. AFTER  RECORDING,
REGISTRATION IS DONE ON THE BASIS OF THE PROGRAMME TITLE. SUBJECT ENTRIES ARE
MADE NOT ACCORDING TO UDC, BUT TO THE LIBRARY'S OWN ESTIMATE OF USERS' NEEDS.
