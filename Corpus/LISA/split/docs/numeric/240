LIBRARY AS A MUNICIPAL INFORMATION CENTRE.

A SURVEY CARRIED OUT IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN SWEDEN SHOWS THAT MOST LIBRARIES
OBTAIN MATERIALS AND INFORMATION CONCERNING LOCAL GOVERNMENT MATTERS.
POLITICAL PARTIES AND LOCAL ORGANISATIONS ARE NOT USING LIBRARIES TO DISPLAY
INFORMATION. LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES ARE PASSIVE ABOUT ACQUIRING ANY MATERIALS
ON LOCAL AFFAIRS. ONLY 14% OF THEM HAD CONTACTS WITH SOME LOCAL ORGANISATIONS.
ONLY 19 LIBRARIES MADE DISPLAYS OF LOCAL INFORMATION. THERE IS A NEED TO
DEVELOP THE PROVISION OF LOCAL INFORMATION IN LIBRARIES.
