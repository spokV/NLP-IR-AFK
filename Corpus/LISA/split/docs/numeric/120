ARCHIVES AND LIBRARIES.

FOLLOWING A 1979 STUDY TOUR COVERING 6 LOCAL HISTORY ARCHIVES IN DENMARK,
RELATIONSHIPS, JOINT FUNCTIONS AND FINANCE OF SUCH ARCHIVES AND LOCAL HISTORY
COLLECTIONS ARE DISCUSSED. THE 1ST LOCAL HISTORY ARCHIVE IN DENMARK WAS
ESTABLISHED IN FABORG IN 1937; BY 1979 THERE WERE ABOUT 240. A 1978 REPORT
DEFINED MATERIAL BELONGING RESPECTIVELY TO LOCAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS AND LOCAL
HISTORY ARCHIVES, RECOMMENDING COORDINATION BY THE LIBRARY BUT CONSIDERABLE
AUTONOMY FOR THE ARCHIVES. WHILE DETAILS DIFFER, COOPERATION SEEMS GENERALLY
SATISFACTORY. FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS VARY WIDELY, STILL WITH MANY VOLUNTARY
ARCHIVISTS. WITH NO COMPARABLE ACTIVITY IN NORWAY, IT SEEMS NECESSARY TO
SURVEY EXISTING RESOURCES AND INSTITUTIONS AND EVALUATE THE SITUATION.
PRIORITIES ARE COLLECTION, ARRANGEMENT AND INDEXING, CONSERVATION, AND
AVAILABILITY. PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THOUGH THE NATURAL HOME FOR LOCAL HISTORY
ARCHIVES, WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCE AND STAFFING. LOCAL ORGANISATIONS
SHOULD  BE APPROACHED, MANPOWER AND RESOURCES COORDINATED, AND HELP SOUGHT
FROM REGIONAL AND CENTRAL AUTHORITIES.
