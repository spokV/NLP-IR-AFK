WHAT'S TO BE DONE? MEASURES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION
AND LITERATURE PROVISION.
     
THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY'S TASKS AND DUTIES IN WEST GERMANY
MUST BE CHANGED; OUTDATED STANDARDS ARE A HINDRANCE. THE CONCEPT SHOULD DEMAND
A FUNDAMENTAL UNITY OF PURPOSE AGREED BETWEEN LOCAL COUNCILLORS AND
ADMINISTRATION AND PROVIDE TASKS FOR THE LIBRARY WITHOUT PEDANTIC EMPHASIS ON
THEORETICAL NICETIES. THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING CAN ASSIST IN
EXPLAINING THE PURPOSES AND FUNCTIONS OF LIBRARIANSHIP TO THE ADMINISTRATION.
LIBRARIES MUST EXPRESS THE NEED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM THROUGH THEIR STAFF
ASSOCIATIONS. CURRENT PLANS FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE REASSESSED.
FEDERAL MINISTRIES AND ADVISORY CENTRES SHOULD BE MORE CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH
LIBRARIES AND MORE USE SHOULD BE MADE OF MASS MEDIA PUBLICITY. SURVEYS SHOULD
BE CARRIED OUT ON LIBRARY USE AND LARGE LIBRARIES SHOULD ASSIST IN THE
FINANCING OF LIBRARY RESEARCH.
