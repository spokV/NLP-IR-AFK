LIBRARY WORK AMONG DELHI'S ILLITERATES.
     
DESCRIBES DELHI PUBLIC LIBRARY, OPENED IN 1951. BORROWING IS FREE, ALTHOUGH
THERE IS AN INITIAL DEPOSIT TOO HIGH FOR MANY PEOPLE. THE LIBRARY RUNS 4
REGIONAL LIBRARIES WITH 20 BRANCH LIBRARIES, EVENTUALLY TO BE SELF-GOVERNING.
IT ALSO HAS DEPOSIT COLLECTIONS IN 3 HOSPITALS, THE PRISON, AND INSTITUTIONS
FOR THE BLIND, USING THE LIBRARY'S OWN BRAILLE BOOKS. MATERIALS HAVE TO BE IN
MANY LANGUAGES, WITH HINDI, URDU, PUNJABI AND ENGLISH THE MOST COMMON. THERE
IS AN ADULT LENDING SECTION, READING ROOM, REFERENCE SECTION, AND CHILDREN'S
SECTION; THE LATTER IS, HOWEVER, GIVEN LOW PRIORITY. THE LIBRARY ARRANGES FREE
ACTIVITIES FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN, SUCH AS FILMS, BOOK-TALKS, AUTHOR
WORK-SHOPS, AND ORGANISES STUDY GROUPS. THE BOOK SELECTION PROCEDURES ARE
SOMEWHAT HAPHAZARD; STRESS IS ON INDIAN AND WESTERN CLASSICS. SOME POPULAR
SCIENTIFIC WORKS ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN HINDI. DELHI PUBLIC LIBRARY APPEARS A
TRADITIONAL WESTERN LIBRARY SERVICE, WITH LITTLE ATTEMPT TO CATER FOR THE MASS
OF ILLITERATE AND POTENTIAL USERS.
