THE ROLE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN THE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF LIBRARY STAFF.
     
LIBRARIANS NEED TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF PSYCHOLOGY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE
EFFECTIVE READING GUIDANCE TO LIBRARY USERS. PSYCHOLOGY SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL
PART OF THE SYLLABUS TAUGHT IN LIBRARY SCHOOLS, WITH A STUDY OF GENERAL
PRINCIPLES LEADING ON TO MORE SPECIALISED FIELDS. THE COURSE TAUGHT AT THE
LENINGRADSKII GOSUDARSTVENNYI INSTITUT KUL'TURY IM. N.K. KRUPSKOI (N.K.
KRUPSKAYA STATE INSTITUTE OF CULTURE IN LENINGRAD) SHOWS SOME OF THE
POSSIBILITIES AVAILABLE, BUT THERE IS MUCH WORK TO BE DONE IN THE PROFESSION
AS A WHOLE.
