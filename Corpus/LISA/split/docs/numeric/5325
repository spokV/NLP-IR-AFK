ON-LINE LENDING REGISTRATION. A PILOT PROJECT OF THE STATE OF
BADEN-WURTTEMBERG.

IN 1975 A RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE IN THE BADEN-WURTTEMBERG LIBRARY PLANS TO
INTRODUCE COMPUTERISED LENDING SYSTEMS IN ALL UNIVERSITY AND STATE LIBRARIES.
A PILOT PROJECT TO TEST THE POSSIBILITIES OF SUCH A SYSTEM WAS STARTED IN
FREIBURG UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN OCT 77. THE AUTOMATION PROGRESSED IN 3 PHASES'
THE FICTION AND TEXT BOOK COLLECTION; THE PUBLIC BOOK COLLECTION; THE
STOCKROOM COLLECTION. A DIETZ STANDARD COMPUTER SYSTEM WITH ADAPTATIONS FOR A
LENDING SYSTEM WAS USED. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE AUTOMATED PROCESS IN THE 1ST
2 STAGES OF THE PLAN WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND LED TO PREPARATIONS BEING MADE
FOR OTHER LIBRARIES IN TUBINGEN AND KARLSRUHE TO ADOPT THE SYSTEM. THE 3RD
PHASE WILL BE COMPLETED BY THE BEGINNING OF 1982. THE COMPUTERISED LENDING
SYSTEM LED TO AN INCREASE IN LENDING FROM 350,000 IN 1975 TO 700,000 IN 1980
WHICH REFLECTS A CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENT IN THE LIBRARY USER SERVICE.
