PERSPECTIVES ON ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES IN THE 1980S' INDICATORS
FROM A DELPHI STUDY.
     
A DELPHI STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO IDENTIFY THE CHANGES IN LIBRARY ROLES AND
FUNCTIONS THAT THE DIRECTORS OF ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES BELIEVE
WILL OCCUR OVER THE NEXT DECADE. THE METHODOLOGY IS DESCRIBED AND THE RESULTS
ARE SUMMARISED. 2 SCENARIOS RESULTED' ONE HIGHLY DESIRABLE; THE OTHER, HIGHLY
PROBABLE, AND THEY OVERLAP BY 64%. LIBRARY DIRECTORS EXPECT MODERATE
EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS. USERS ARE PERCEIVED TO BE THE FORCE
MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO, WHILE TECHNOLOGY IS THE FORCE ADVANCING CHANGE.
THE ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGY IS SEEN AS DESIRABLE AND WITHIN THE LIBRARIES' SPAN
OF CONTROL. EDUCATION AND SERVICE ROLES OF LIBRARIANS WILL EXPAND. LIBRARY AND
INSTITUTIONAL PRIORITIES ARE SEEN AS OBSTACLES TO CHANGE.
