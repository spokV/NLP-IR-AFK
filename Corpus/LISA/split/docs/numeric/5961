ORIGIN OF WRITING.

FOR MANY YEARS SPEECH AND GESTURE WERE MAN'S ONLY FORMS OF COMMUNICATION, AND
WRITING EMERGED AS A MORE EFFECTIVE AND LASTING FORM OF COMMUNICATION IN THE
4TH MILLENIUM B.C. ALTHOUGH ITS ORIGIN IS UNKNOWN, OUR PRESENT ALPHABET IS
DERIVED FROM THE PHOENICIAN ALPHABET, AND AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, THE
MESOPOTAMIANS, SUMERIANS, EGYPTIANS, CHINESE AND OTHERS BEGAN TO DEVELOP FORMS
OF WRITING.
