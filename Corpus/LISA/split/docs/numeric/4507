ART LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS WORLDWIDE' THEIR HISTORY AND FUTURE.
     
(PAPER PRESENTED TO THE ART LIBRARIES SECTION AT THE IFLA CONFERENCE, LEIPZIG,
AUG 81.) THE WORLDWIDE COMPASS OF THE VISUAL ARTS AND THEIR PARALLEL
DOCUMENTATION BRINGS WITH IT THE NECESSITY FOR A WORLDWIDE NETWORK OF
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, COMMUNICATION AND ORGANISATION BETWEEN ART LIBRARIES.
THIS, AND THE PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO MATERIAL AND READERS, GIVES ART
LIBRARIANSHIP ITS DISTINCTION-ONE WHICH, WITHIN ART LIBRARY ORGANISATIONS AND
WITHIN IFLA, HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY DEVELOPED AND SHARED OVER THE YEARS. A
PARTICULAR DUTY OF THE ART LIBRARIAN NOW MUST BE TO HELP PRESERVE THE LOCAL
AND NATIONAL QUALITIES OF ART AND LIFE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE
INTERNATIONAL SCENE.
