ON-LINE FORECASTING CAPABILITIES' FUTURSCAN AND ITS ALTERNATIVES.

PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE FIELD OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS
WHOSE DATA BASES ARE PROGRAMMED TO PREDICT FUTURE EVENTS. THESE SYSTEMS RELY
ON DATA OF PAST EVENTS AND USE MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES SUCH AS REGRESSION
ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL PROBABILITY TO PROVIDE FORECAST DATA. THE HISTORY OF
THESE SYSTEMS IS TRACED THROUGH THE ADVENT OF THE IBM QUICKTRAN PROGRAM IN
1967 AND DESCRIPTIONS OF 13 OTHER PREDICTIVE SYSTEMS. RECENT TREND IMPACT
ANALYSIS STUDIES HAVE LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERAX AND FUTURSCAN, WHICH
OFFER SOPHISTICATED AND COMPLEX PREDICTIVE ON-LINE CAPABILITIES. REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
