THE GOVERNMENT LIBRARY AS A COMMUNITY RESOURCE.
     
THE CONSUMER INFORMATION CENTRE OF THE MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL
RELATIONS IS PROVIDING SERVICES AND PROGRAMMES TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT
AND USE OF COMMUNITY-BASED CONSUMER INFORMATION SERVICES AND RESOURCES. BY
WORKING WITH EXISTING NETWORKS OF INFORMATION SUPPLIERS, THE CENTRE SEEKS TO
MINIMISE DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND TO MAXIMISE ACCESS TO CONSUMER INFORMATION.
SPECIFIC STRATEGIES ARE DISCUSSED WHICH MAY HAVE APPLICATION TO OTHER
GOVERNMENT LIBRARIES AND TO THOSE WITH RESPONSIBILITIES TO MULTIPLE CLIENT
GROUPS WHICH ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY REMOTE.
