THE SUITABILITY OF BOOK AND ARTICLE TITLES FOR SUBJECT CATALOGUING.

FOR ECONOMIC REASONS THE VIABILITY OF AUTOMATED SUBJECT CATALOGUING USING MAIN
ENTRIES IS OFTEN CONSIDERED. BASIC DATA AVAILABLE FOR THIS ARE THE TITLE,
SUB-TITLE AND CIP DATA BUT ALTHOUGH THE TITLE MAY IMPORTANT IT DOES NOT ALWAYS
EXPRESS THE SUBJECT CONTENT ACCURATELY. IN POPULAR LITERATURE THE TITLE MAY BE
EYE-CATCHING RATHER THAN ACCURATE. PROBLEMS CAN ALSO BE CAUSED BY FOREIGN
LANGUAGES, ABBREVIATIONS, SHORTENED OR LENGTHENED NAMES FOR THE SAME OBJECT,
HOMONYMS AND SYNONYMS, ESPECIALLY IN GEOGRAPHICAL MATERIAL. MANY TITLES ARE
VAGUE AND INCOMPLETE OR EVEN INCOMPREHENSIBLE IF THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOK IS
NOT ALREADY KNOWN. USE OF THE TITLE IN AUTOMATED SUBJECT CATALOGUING WOULD
SAVE WORK TIME BUT RESULT IN MANY FALSE ENTRIES.
