DO LIBRARIANS CARE FOR THEIR PAST?.

A SURVEY OF ALL 166 PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITIES IN THE UK WAS CARRIED OUT TO
DETERMINE WHETHER LIBRARIANS TAKE AS MUCH CARE IN PRESERVING THE
CORRESPONDENCE, MEMORANDA, PLANS, MINUTES AND OTHER RECORDS OF THE PAST, AS
THEY DO IN PRESERVING INFORMATION ABOUT ALL SORTS OF OTHER ORGANISATIONS. IN
MANY CASES THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF A LACK OF CLEARLY THOUGHT-OUT POLICIES.
REVIEWS THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY HISTORICAL
PERSPECTIVE ON CURRENT PROBLEMS THE NEED FOR A USABLE FUND OF SOURCE MATERIAL
IS INESCAPABLE.
