INDEX SYSTEM FOR PERSONAL REFERENCE SOURCES.
     
SEVERAL NORWEGIAN BUSINESS INFORMATION ORGANISATIONS COOPERATED DURING 1974-76
TO DEVELOP A COMPUTERISED REFERENCE SYSTEM (USIS) FOR LINKING ENQUIRERS WITH
PERSONAL, NOT BIBLIOGRAPHICAL, REFERENCE SOURCES. PEOPLE PRODUCE KNOWLEDGE;
THE HUMAN BRAIN IS AN UNSURPASSED 'DATA BASE'; AND PRECISE INFORMATION CAN BE
REQUESTED AND OBTAINED THROUGH CONVERSATION. THE BASIC REFERENCE UNIT CHOSEN
WAS THE SPECIALIST DEPARTMENT OR INSTITUTION, AND IN APR 79 1,200 REFERENCE
SOURCES WERE REGISTERED, REPRESENTING 550 NORWEGIAN INSTITUTIONS. INDEXING OF
SOURCES IS BASED ON ANNUAL REPORTS, CHECKED BY THE INSTITUTIONS. INSTITUTIONS
CAN BE APPROACHED INDIVIDUALLY IF THE PROBLEM REQUIRES PRECISE DEFINITION, OR
THE INDEX USED ALONE VIA A COMPUTER TERMINAL. DATA ON PERSONAL REFERENCE
SOURCES MUST BE CONSTANTLY UPDATED. SIMILAR SYSTEMS EXIST IN OTHER COUNTRIES,
AND THE IDEA COULD BE EXTENDED' ALL USERS OF COMPUTER TERMINALS (8,000 IN
NORWAY IN 1978, ESTIMATED TO REACH 2 0,000 IN 1985) ARE POTENTIAL CLIENTS.
POSSIBLE DANGERS OF MONOPOLY, ABUSE, OR TAKEOVER BY A FOREIGN POWER SHOULD BE
TECHNICALLY AVOIDABLE.
