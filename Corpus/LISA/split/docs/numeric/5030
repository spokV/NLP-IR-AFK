SHOULD HOPE BE ABANDONED BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS?.

THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE WORD 'PUBLIC' MUST BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY IN
CONNECTION WITH LIBRARIES. PARTICULAR PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED IN SELECTING FICTION
AND LEISURE MATERIAL. READERS DISLIKE EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF TRIVIAL MATERIAL AS
MUCH AS THE ELITIST APPROACH BUT THE ILLITERACY OF SOME SECTIONS OF THE PUBLIC
IS PREFERABLE TO THE TOTAL ABSTINENCE OF THE NON-READER. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
MUST BRING A NEW QUALITY TO ITS PUBLIC SERVICE, EXERCISING A CORRECTIVE
FUNCTION IN RESPECT OF BOOK MARKET TRENDS. LIBRARIANS MUST MOUNT AN OFFENSIVE
ACTION IN PURSUIT OF THE SENSIBLE, SOCIAL AND HUMANE ASPECTS OF THEIR SERVICE.
IT IS DANGEROUS TO ATTACH TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO STATISTICS. LITERATURE SHOULD
BE PROVIDED THAT CROSSES ALL ARBITRARY BORDERS AND STIMULATES THE MIND.
