ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS AND THE FUTURE OF PAPER AND MICROFORM PUBLISHING.

CONSIDERS THE 2 ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS NOW IN EXISTENCE (ON-LINE AND VIDEO-DISK)
AND THEIR IMPACT ON MICROFORMS AND TRADITIONAL PUBLISHING. CONCLUDES THAT THE

SYSTEMS AND THAT TRADITIONAL PAPER PUBLISHING AND ITS MORE RECENT ADJUNCT,
MICROPUBLISHING, HAVE A LONG FUTURE AHEAD OF THEM BEFORE THE NEWER
TECHNOLOGIES MAKE SIGNIFICANT INROADS INTO THEIR DOMAIN.
