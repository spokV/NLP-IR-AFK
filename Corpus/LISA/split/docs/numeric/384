THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUBJECT INDEX FOR THE DUTCH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.

IN MAY 80 THE JOINT WORKING PARTIES ON THE DUTCH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND THE
DUTCH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CENTRE PUBLISHED THEIR FINAL REPORT CONTAINING
PROPOSALS FOR A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IN THE NETHERLANDS BASED ON BRINKMANN'S
CATALOGUE OF BOOKS. IN VIEW OF THE LIMITED NUMBER OF TERMS USED IN THE SUBJECT
INDEX OF BRINKMANN'S CATALOGUE IT WAS PROPOSED TO ADOPT THE THESAURUS OF
HEADINGS DEVELOPED BY THE NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH
CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) WITH THE ADDITION OF UDC AND SISO
CLASSIFICATION NUMBERS TO EACH ENTRY. A TEST-RUN HAS IDENTIFIED A CORE OF SOME
3,500 HEADINGS WHICH WILL BE INPUT INTO THE DATA BASE TO PROVIDE A SUBJECT
INDEX TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHY. THE SYSTEM WILL BECOME OPERATIONAL ON 1 JAN 81.
