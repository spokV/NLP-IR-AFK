A RATIONALIST'S CRITIQUE OF BOOK SELECTION FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.

ACADEMIC LIBRARY COLLECTIONS HAVE, HISTORICALLY, BEEN SELECTED BY THE FACULTY
OF THE INSTITUTION WHICH THEY LIBRARY SERVES. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, MUCH
RESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT HAS DEVOLVED UPON LIBRARIANS WHO ARE
EAGER TO RETAIN AND AMPLIFY THEIR ROLE IN THIS AREA. ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN
FAVOUR OF LODGING COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT RESPONSIBLITY WITH LIBRARIANS ARE,
HOWEVER, LESS THAN CONVINCING AND IGNORE IMPORTANT REALITIES TO MAKE THEIR
CASE. LIBRARIANS OFTEN CONFUSE THE ABILITY TO SELECT BOOKS WITH ACCOUNTABILITY
FOR SUCH SELECTION. ARGUES THAT BOOK SELECTION IS MORE PROPERLY AND MORE
ADEQUATELY DONE BY FACULTY MEMBERS THAN LIBRARIANS, AND SUGGESTS A WAY OF
DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY OFTEN ENCOUNTERED WHEN FACULTY ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR SELECTION.
