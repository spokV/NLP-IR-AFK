THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND THE POPULATION.
     
AMPLIFIES THE INFORMATION ON THE USE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES INCLUDED IN PREVIOUS
LEISURE TIME RESEARCH BY DESCRIBING A SURVEY OF MORE THAN 4,000 MEMBERS OF THE
DANISH POPULATION. USERS AS WELL AS NON-USERS WERE INTERVIEWED, INCLUDING
CHILDREN. THE REPORT IS SUBDIVIDED ACCORDING TO AGE; ADULTS, OLDER SCHOOL
CHILDREN, YOUNGER SCHOOL CHILDREN, AND PRESCHOOL CHILDREN, AND CONTAINS
SECTIONS DEALING WITH NON-USERS. HALF THE POPULATION USES THE LIBRARY, BUT THE
INCIDENCE DECREASES WITH AGE, AND THE HIGHER THE DENSITY OF POPULATION, THE
GREATER THE % OF LIBRARY USERS. THE MOST CONCLUSIVE FACTOR WAS THE PERSON'S
LENGTH OF EDUCATION. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
