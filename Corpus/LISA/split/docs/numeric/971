A PROBLEM SITUATION AND WAYS OF OVERCOMING IT.

AT PRESENT 97% OF SOVIET FAMILIES POSSESS HOME LIBRARIES, AND 70% OF THE
POPULATION READS FOR 1 HOUR DAILY. CONSEQUENTLY TRADITIONAL EDITIONS OF
200,000 TO 500,000 COPIES FAIL TO SATISFY DEMAND. INTERLIBRARY LOANS AND
PROVIDING LIBRARIES WITH SUPPLEMENTARY COPIES OF POPULAR BOOKS COULD FURNISH
BETTER SATISFACTION. BOOKSELLERS, LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY-USERS SHOULD HELP TO
DETERMINE SIZE OF EDITIONS. THE MEDIA, READERS AND LIBRARIANS SHOULD PERSUADE
THE PUBLIC THAT READING BOOKS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN COLLECTING THEM.
INFORMATION USED ONCE ONLY COULD APPEAR IN 'TELEJOURNALS'. SOME PUBLISHERS
SHOULD PRODUCE MULTI-MILLION, MODERATELY PRICED EDITIONS OF CLASSIC AND MODERN
LITERATURE FOR HOME USE, WHILE OTHERS PROVIDED LARGE STOUTLY-BOUND EDITIONS
FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES. BOOKSELLERS, PUBLISHERS, LIBRARIANS AND READERS SHOULD
JOIN TO DISCUSS THESE QUESTIONS.
