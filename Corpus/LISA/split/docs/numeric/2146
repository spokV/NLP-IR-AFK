REVIEWS AND REVIEW PUBLICATIONS IN PHYSICS AND SOME CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING
THEIR EFFECTIVENESS.
     
SOME RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO REVIEWS AND REVIEW ISSUES ON PHYSICS ARE
SUMMARISED AND THE ESTABLISHED SYSTEM OF THE REVIEW LITERATURE IS ANALYSED.
THE PROBLEMS OF CLASSIFYING REVIEWS ARE DISCUSSED AND A DIFFERENTIATED
APPROACH TO THE REVIEW INFORMATION SYSTEM IN PHYSICS IS OUTLINED. POSSIBLE
EVALUATION CRITERIA ARE DISCUSSED. IT IS SHOWN THAT CITATION ANALYSIS AND
QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION METHODS ARE LOSING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN THIS AREA.
