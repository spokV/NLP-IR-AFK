INFORMATION-PROCESSING MODELS OF COGNITION.

REVIEWS RECENT PROGRESS IN MODELLING HUMAN COGNITIVE PROCESSES. PARTICULAR
ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE USE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AS A FORMALISM
FOR MODELLING, AND TO COMPUTER SIMULATION OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE SYSTEMS
MODELLED. THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT DEAL AT ALL WITH NEURAL MODELS; IT FOCUSSES
MAINLY UPON HIGHER MENTAL PROCESSES, BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME ATTENTION TO
MODELLING THE ELEMENTARY PROCESSES AND ESPECIALLY TO THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
ELEMENTARY AND COMPLEX PROCESSES.
