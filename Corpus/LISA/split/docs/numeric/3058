SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES.
     
THE 12TH CONGRESS OF THE BULGARIAN COMMUNIST PARTY SET IMPORTANT TARGETS IN
RESPECT OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE RESULT OF INTENSIVE APPLICATION
OF CHEMISTRY, AUTOMATION AND ROBOTICS. SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES HAVE
A SIGNIFICANT PART TO PLAY ASSISTING WITH THEIR SERVICES IN IMPLEMENTATION OF
THE TARGETS. THE MAJORITY OF YOUNG SCIENTISTS HAVE A GOOD COMMAND OF AT LEAST
1 WESTERN LANGUAGE AND RUSSIAN LITERATURE IS IN GENERAL USE. HOWEVER, THERE IS
STILL MUCH TO BE DONE TO ATTRACT SCIENTISTS AND OTHER EXPERTS WHO HAVE BEEN
AVOIDING LIBRARIES SO FAR. PERSONAL RAPPORT WITH SUCH PEOPLE IS DECISIVE AND
LIBRARIANS SHOULD DRAW IDEAS FROM INSTRUCTIVE PUBLICATIONS ISSUED FOR THIS
PURPOSE BY MANY CENTRAL LIBRARIES. IN ADDITION TO BOOKS, PERIODICALS, PATENTS,
TRADE CATALOGUES AND SECONDARY INFORMATION SOURCES HAVE TO BE UTILISED TO THE
FULL. LIBRARIES NEED EQUIPMENT TO BE ABLE TO OFFER TO THEIR READERS
INFORMATION ON MICROFORM.
