EVALUATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL ACTIVITIES IN CURITIBA.

REPORT OF A STUDY CONCERNING LOCAL PRODUCTION OF CATALOGUES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIES
IN CURITIBA, BRAZIL. EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH PUBLISHERS COMPLY WITH LEGAL
DEPOSIT REGULATIONS, CATALOGUING IN PUBLICATION PROJECTS, AND THE NATIONALLY
RECOMMENDED PUBLISHING STANDARDS. DATA COLLECTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF PARANA
LIBRARY SCHOOL WAS USED TO ANALYSE COVERAGE BY BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND UNION
CATALOGUES PUBLISHED OVER THE DECADE 1970-80; RESULTS SHOWED THAT LOCAL
LIBRARIANS WERE CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CREATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC TOOLS,
WHILE PUBLISHERS GENERALLY DISREGARDED THEIR OBLIGATIONS. RECOMMENDS STRICTER
ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL DEPOSIT AND GREATER ENCOURAGEMENT FOR LOCAL LIBRARY
ACTIVITIES.
