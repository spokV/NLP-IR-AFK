PATENT COVERAGE BY ABSTRACTING SERVICES. 4. COVERAGE OF MICROBIOLOGICAL
PATENTS.
     
REPORTS A STUDY ON THE COVERAGE BY 7 MAJOR ABSTRACTING SERVICES IN THE FIELD
OF MICROBIOLOGY IN REGARD TO PATENTS. ONLY 3 OF THE SERVICES-2CHEMICAL
ABSTRACTS, MICROBIOLOGY ABSTRACTS, SECTION +A, 1AND 2FOOD SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY ABSTRACTS1-COVER PATENTS AT ALL. THE 3 SERVICES WERE ASSESSED IN
TERMS OF THE INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE ABOUT PATENTS AND IN TERMS OF THEIR
PERFORMANCE IN RETRIEVING PATENTS TAKEN FROM A MASTER LIST OF PATENTS ON
GENETIC ENGINEERING AND VITAMIN D, OBTAINED BY SEARCHES ON 2WORLD PATENTS
INDEX. 1TIMELINESS OF THE SERVICES WAS ALSO ASSESSED. IT WAS FOUND THAT NONE
OF THE STANDARD ABSTRACTING SERVICES IN THE FIELD COVER PATENTS SATISFACTORILY
AND THEY ARE SLOW IN PICKING UP PATENTS. THE RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT BY
SCANNING JUST JAPANESE, U.S.S.R. U.S., AND U.K. PATENTS, BOTH TIMELY AND
COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE MICROBIOLOGICAL PATENT LITERATURE CAN BE
OBTAINED.
