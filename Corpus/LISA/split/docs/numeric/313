AUTOMATED TEXT PROCESSING AS AN AID TO RATIONALISING PURCHASING AND STOCK
ADMINISTRATION IN DOCUMENTATION.

FORMERLY MOST INFORMATION HAD TO BE OBTAINED FROM ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS,
RESULTING IN THE RECOVERY OF ONLY A FEW COINCIDENTAL REFERENCES. THE USE OF
ON-LINE TECHNIQUES FACILITATES THE MAKING OF GLOBAL INFORMATION SURVEYS
INDEPENDENT OF SOURCES AT HAND. AUTOMATED TEXT PROCESSING REDUCES THE NEED FOR
DIRECT CONTACT WITH PUBLISHED MATERIAL AND MAINTENANCE OF ORIGINAL STOCKS. THE
SULZER COMPANY USES AUTOMATED TEXT PROCESSING IN ORDERING AND SUPPLY OF
INFORMATION, FOR THE CATALOGUE, ACCESSIONS INDEX, PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION
CONTROL AND PRINTING THE PERIODICAL INDEX; THE COMPUTER SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED IN
DETAIL. CONTROL OF PERIODICAL CIRCULATION IS ALSO BEING INCORPORATED INTO THE
SYSTEM. THUS WORK PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN REDUCED, LEAVING STAFF FREE FOR MORE
DEMANDING TASKS.
