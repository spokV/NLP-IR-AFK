HAS THE 'IN-HOUSE' SYNDROME GONE TOO FAR?.

THE 1959 NATIONAL PRINTING STRIKE FORCED MANY COMPANIES AND ORGANISATIONS TO
INSTALL IN-HOUSE PRINTING UNITS, AND MANY LATER ADDED MICROFORM UNITS. THE LOW
AVERAGE QUALITY OF MICROFORM PRODUCED AND THE POOR ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF SUCH
UNITS, SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS IN THESE TIMES OF RECESSION AND INCREASING
COMPETITION IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR MANY LARGE ORGANISATIONS TO CUT BACK
ON SUCH LUXURIES AND START TO SUPPORT SMALL LOCAL SERVICE BUSINESSMEN MORE.
