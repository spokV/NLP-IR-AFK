BOOKS AND PEOPLE: THE DESIRABILITY OF COORDINATED RESEARCH.
     
RESEARCH INTO REASONS WHY CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE POPULATION MAKE LITTLE USE
OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT IN THE PLANNING OF
LIBRARY POLICY. IN THE PAST TOO MUCH RESEARCH INTO LIBRARY USE HAS SERVED ONLY
TO CONFIRM WHAT WAS ALREADY SUSPECTED, THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS BELONG MAINLY
TO THE HIGHER INCOME AND BETTER EDUCATED SECTIONS OF SOCIETY. IN THE
NETHERLANDS THE BUREAU VOOR DE COLLECTIEVE PROPAGANDA VAN HET NEDERLANDSE BOEK
(OFFICE FOR THE JOINT PROMOTION OF DUTCH BOOKS) HAS DESIGNATED A 'BOOK OF THE
MONTH' AS A SPECIAL OFFER EACH MONTH SINCE 1970. A NEW ORGANISATION SHOULD BE
CREATED IN THE NETHERLANDS WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE PUBLISHING HOUSES,
ALL SECTIONS OF THE LIBRARY WORLD AND FROM GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS TO
INVESTIGATE WAYS OF STIMULATING, COORDINATING AND SUBSIDISING THE NATION'S
READING HABITS.
