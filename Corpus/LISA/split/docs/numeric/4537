OSLO AND ITS MOST IMPORTANT LIBRARIES.
     
OSLO, WITH 456,000 INHABITANTS, ENJOYS A PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE FROM 2 MAIN
CENTRES-THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY (UBO) AND THE DEICHMANSKE BIBLIOTEKET. THE UBO
SERVES BOTH AS A UNIVERSITY AND NATIONAL LIBRARY, THEREBY CREATING A SERIES OF
DIFFICULTIES IN THE STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION OF THE SERVICE. BIBLIOGRAPHIC WORK
HAS BEEN FACILITATED BY THE USE OF COMPUTERS, AND NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE IN PROCESS. THE PUBLIC HAS A SINGLE ALPHABETICAL AUTHOR AND
SUBJECT CATALOGUE, AND BUREAUCRATIC FORMALITIES HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO A
MINIMUM. THE DEICHMANSKE IS DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHER SCANDINAVIAN LIBRARIES BY
ITS WIDESPREAD SERVICE TO SCHOOLS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES. IT AIMS TO
PROCURE AND LEND BOOKS UNOBTAINABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. BOTH LIBRARIES LEAVE
THE IMPRESSION OF AN EFFICIENT SERVICE WHICH HAS ELIMINATED ALL SOURCES OF
DISCOURAGEMENT TO USERS.
