INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.

ONE OF THE WAYS OF INCREASING THE CONTRIBUTION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION
SERVICES TO SCIENTIFIC CREATIVE WORK IS THROUGH THEIR IDENTIFICATION WITH THE
LOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL AND ORGANISATIONAL NEEDS OF THE RESEARCH
PROCESS. COOPERATION ITSELF BETWEEN RESEARCH AND INFORMATION WORKERS CAN BEGIN
EVEN BEFORE THERE IS A SPECIFIC RESEARCH TASK; SOME INSTITUTIONS HAVE
EXPERIMENTED WITH THE POLICY THAT EACH NEW RESEARCHER HAS TO SPEND A MONTH OR
2 IN THE INFORMATION DEPARTMENT. THE COOPERATION GOES THROUGH SEVERAL STAGES,
FROM THE PRELIMINARY SEARCH TO AVOID DUPLICATION IN RESEARCH TO THE CLOSER
COLLABORATION OF BOTH PARTNERS' TEAMS. SOMETIMES THE COLLABORATION IS SO CLOSE
THAT AN INFORMATION SCIENTIST BECOMES A CO-AUTHOR.
