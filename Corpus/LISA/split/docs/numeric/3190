GEAC; A BRIEF INTRODUCTION.
     
DESCRIBES THE GEAC COMPUTER CORPORATION'S ON-LINE LIBRARY INFORMATION SYSTEM
AND PLANS FOR ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. STARTED IN 1977, THE SYSTEM WAS
DEVELOPED FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, BUT HAS ACCOMMODATED THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
SITUATION. IT IS ADAPTED AT SPECIFIC POINTS TO INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY POLICY. IT
CARRIES OUT STANDARD LIBRARY FUNCTIONS AND ALSO CONTAINS A PUBLIC QUERY MODULE
WHEREBY A PATRON (IDENTIFIED BY MEANS OF A PERSONAL BARCODE) CAN SEARCH HIS
PERSONAL RECORD OR (NO IDENTIFICATION NEEDED) THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC FILE.
