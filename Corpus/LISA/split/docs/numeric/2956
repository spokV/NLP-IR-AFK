CHARACTERISTICS OF MICROS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS.
     
IN RECENT YEARS, THE MARKET IN MICROCOMPUTERS HAS MUSHROOMED MAKING SUCH
FACILITIES AND POWER OF MINICOMPUTERS OR EVEN SMALL MAINFRAMES. GIVES A BRIEF
HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MICROCOMPUTERS AND DESCRIBES THE VARIOUS
COMPONENTS OF SUCH A SYSTEM. PAYS PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE TYPE OF
COMPONENT THAT IS LIKELY TO BE AVAILABLE IN SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS
'SMALL BUSINESS SYSTEMS' AND INVESTIGATES THE APPLICATIONS OF SUCH SYSTEMS.
DESPITE THE VAST MARKET IN MICROCOMPUTERS, THERE ARE STILL MANY RESTRICTIONS
WHICH MAY PREVENT THEIR BEING USED IN SOME APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS THE CAPACITY
OF THE PRIMARY MEMORY. FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE VERY FEW STANDARDS IN THE AREA
OF MICROCOMPUTERS, LEADING TO PROBLEMS OF COMPATIBILITY BOTH FROM THE HARDWARE
AND SOFTWARE VIEWPOINT. SUCH PROBLEMS ARE BEING OVERCOME AT PRESENT BUT IT IS
LIKELY THAT THEY WILL PERSIST FOR SOME TIME TO  COME AS THE PRESSURES OF
MARKETING CANNOT WAIT FOR STANDARDS TO BE DEVELOPED. THE RESTRICTIONS OF
MICROCOMPUTERS ARE ALSO BEING OVERCOME, PARTICULARLY WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF
16-BIT (AND EVEN 32-BIT) PROCESSORS AND MORE SOPHISTICATED METHODS OF STORAGE,
SUCH AS 'BUBBLE MEMORIES'. EXAMINES SUCH DEVELOPMENTS AND BRIEFLY CONTRASTS
DEVELOPMENTS IN HARDWARE WITH THOSE IN SOFTWARE.
