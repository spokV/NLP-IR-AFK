LIBRARIES AND THE NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING IMMIGRANT.

EXPLAINS HOW AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES CAN HELP NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING
IMMIGRANTS TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE BY FUNCTIONING AS CLEARINGHOUSES REGARDING
THE AVAILABILITY OF ENGLISH-LANGUAGE CLASSES AND COURSES; STOCKING THE
APPROPRIATE LEARNING MATERIAL, AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS FROM IMMIGRANTS' NATIVE
COUNTRIES (THESE ARE ATTUNED TO THEIR EXPERIENCES AND CAN BE PRESENTED
BILINGUALLY), AND COPIES OF TELEVISION AND RADIO ENGLISH LESSONS; COOPERATING
WITH SCHOOL LIBRARIES; ESTABLISHING LINKS WITH ETHNIC CLUBS AND RELIGIOUS
CENTRES; AND ESTABLISHING OUTREACH ACTIVITIES TO PUBLICISE THE LIBRARY TO
TRADITIONALLY NON-LIBRARY USERS.
