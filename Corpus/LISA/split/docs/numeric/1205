AN ALL YEAR ROUND CHILDREN'S BOOK WEEK.

IN THE NETHERLANDS THE ANNUAL CHILDREN'S BOOK WEEK IS ORGANISED BY PUBLISHERS
AND BOOKSELLERS TO PROMOTE THE SALE OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS. LIBRARIANS, HOWEVER,
SHOULD AIM AT ALL YEAR ROUND STIMULATION OF CHILDREN'S READING INTERESTS.
WORKING GROUPS CAN BE FORMED IN EACH COMMUNITY WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE
LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY AND OTHER INTERESTED ORGANISATIONS TO PROVIDE A PROGRAMME
OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES FOR CHILDREN. SUCH ACTIVITIES MAY BE ARRANGED WITH LOCAL
SCHOOLS AS PART OF THE SCHOOL TIMETABLE OR MAY BE PROVIDED OUTSIDE SCHOOL
HOURS. ACTIVITIES MAY INCLUDE READING OF 1 OR MORE SET BOOKS, WRITING SHORT
STORIES AND POETRY, AND PROVIDING ILLUSTRATIONS TO A SET BOOK. CHILDREN WHO
HAVE PARTICIPATED IN SUCH PROGRAMMES OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO
BECOME REGULAR LIBRARY USERS.
