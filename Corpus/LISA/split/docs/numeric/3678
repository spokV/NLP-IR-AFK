ON THE EDGE OF THE DESERT' STATEMENT OF ACHIEVEMENTS BY THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
THE IDEA THAT INCREASES IN LOANS AND STOCKS WOULD BRING ABOUT PROPORTIONAL
INCREASES IN FINANCE, ACCOMMODATION AND STAFF HAS PROVED INCORRECT. STATISTICS
ON LOANS AND STOCKS CONCEAL WEAKNESSES WITHIN A LIBRARY AND THE UNFULFILLED
WISHES OF READERS. THERE IS NO PROSPECT AT PRESENT OF A LIBRARY LAW AND SALARY
NEGOTIATIONS HAVE STOPPED. ONLY 10% OF THE POPULATION USE LIBRARIES' MORE
DEDICATED LIBRARIANS ARE NEEDED TO DEVELOP SOCIAL LIBRARIANSHIP. FREEDOM IN
BOOK SELECTION IS OFTEN THREATENED BY THE ATTITUDE OF LOCAL OFFICIALS AND BY
CONDITIONS ON THE BOOK MARKET. PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN GERMANY HAVE DEVELOPED NOT
IN A UNIFIED FASHION BUT THROUGH A VARIETY OF HISTORICAL CAUSES. THE BEST CURE
OF THESE PROBLEMS WOULD BE AN OPEN AND CRITICAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN LIBRARIANS
AND POLITICIANS.
