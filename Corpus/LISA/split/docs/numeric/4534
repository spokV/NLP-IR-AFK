CHANGING CONCEPTS OF THE ROLE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN
PALESTINE, AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE SHA'AR ZION LIBRARY IN JAFFA AND TEL-AVIV (IN
HEBREW).
     
TRACES THE EVOLVING CONCEPTIONS OF THE ROLE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE SHA'AR ZION
PUBLIC LIBRARY AS FORMULATED BY ITS FOUNDERS, LIBRARIANS AND THE TOWN FATHERS
DURING THE PERIOD OF THE 1ST 4 WAVES OF ZIONIST IMMIGRATION, FROM THE 1880S TO
1931. THE EMPHASIS IS ON ANALYSIS OF THE CLASH BETWEEN THE CONCEPT OF THE
POPULAR PUBLIC LIBRARY, WHOSE PRIMARY PURPOSE WAS TO SERVE PREDOMINANTLY THE
IMMEDIATE AND TOPICAL NEEDS OF THE IMMIGRANTS AND HELP IN THEIR ABSORPTION,
AND THE CONCEPT OF THE SCHOLARLY PUBLIC LIBRARY, WHICH EMPHASISES THE
PROVISION OF SERVICES TO A LIMITED CLIENTELE OF SCHOLARS, WRITERS AND TEACHERS
IN THE FIELD OF JEWISH STUDIES. OPENS WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE SOCIAL
BACKGROUND OF THE PERIOD. THE 2ND PART DEALS WITH THE ORIGINS OF THE SHA'AR
ZION LIBRARY AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE B'NAI
BRITH AND  B'NAI MOSHE ORDERS TOWARDS THE FORMULATION OF ITS MISSION. THE 3RD
AND 4TH SECTIONS ANALYSE THE DELIBERATIONS AND CONTENTIONS OF MEMBERS OF THE
TOWN COUNCIL AND OF ADVISORS WITH REGARD TO LIBRARY OBJECTIVES DURING THE
PERIOD OF THE 3RD AND 4TH WAVES OF IMMIGRATION (1919-31). IN THE LAST SECTION,
ATTEMPTS TO DRAW SOME CONCLUSIONS WITH REGARD TO THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY IN PALESTINE IN THE PROCESS OF REALISATION OF ZIONIST IDEOLOGY,
ESPECIALLY ITS FUNCTION AS AN AGENCY FOR EDUCATING THE POPULACE IN THE SPIRIT
OF THAT IDEOLOGY, AND IN REALISING THE IDEAL OF THE CREATION OF A NEW JEWISH
SOCIETY IN PALESTINE WHICH WOULD PRESERVE AND MAINTAIN ITS CULTURAL EXCELLENCE
AND SUPREMACY.
