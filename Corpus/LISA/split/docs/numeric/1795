THE CONTROL OF AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM'S INPUT FLOW.
     
THE 2 COMMONLY-USED PARAMETERS, BATCH ACCUMULATION TIME AND BATCH SIZE, ARE
INADEQUATE FOR EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM'S INPUT. A
3RD PARAMETER IS REQUIRED TO DESCRIBE DOCUMENT INPUT RATE. SUGGESTS A
DEFINITION FOR THIS PARAMETER, BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS IN EACH
INCOMING GROUP AND THE WAITING TIME BEFORE A BATCH IS COMPLETED, AND NAMES IT
'DOCUMENT FLOW MOMENTUM'. DESCRIBES A METHOD FOR MEASURING IT AND GIVES
EXAMPLES OF ITS USE IN THE OPTIMISATION OF INFORMATION INPUT PERFORMANCE.
