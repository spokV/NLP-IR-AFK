ATTRACTION OF NEW READERS BY CENTRAL REGIONAL AND OTHER PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

AT PRESENT LIBRARIES IN BULGARIA, AS ELSEWHERE, HAVE TO COMPETE WITH MASS
MEDIA, IN PARTICULAR WITH TELEVISION. MIGRATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO TOWNS
HAMPERS EXPANSION OF LIBRARIES IN RURAL AREAS. PEOPLE BUY MORE BOOKS AND USE
PUBLIC LIBRARIES LESS THAN IN THE PAST. IN SPITE OF THIS AS WELL AS SOME OTHER
NEGATIVE FACTORS, INTEREST IN READING HAS INCREASED RECENTLY AND THE
POPULATION'S LEISURE TIME ACTIVITIES HAVE BECOME MORE BALANCED. THUS THE STAFF
IN LOCAL PUBLIC AND CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARIES HAVE TO PLAN CAREFULLY TO
ATTRACT NEW READERS. ALL AGES AND SOCIAL GROUPS MUST BE CATERED FOR. IN
ADDITION TO BOOKS, SPECIAL PRINTED MATERIAL, SUCH AS SHEET-MUSIC AND
REPRODUCTION OF PAINTINGS, MUST BE MORE FULLY USED.
