DO NOT TEAR DOWN WHAT HAS SO SUCCESSFULLY BEEN BUILT UP.
     
REPORTS THE SPEECH BY THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CHAIRMAN, KARL JOHAN
MORTENSEN, TO THE MEETING OF THE KOMMUNERNES LANDSFORENING (NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES), WHERE THE QUESTION HAD EARLIER BEEN RAISED
OF HOW CULTURE COULD BE DISSEMINATED TO LARGER CIRCLES. IT WAS ARGUED THAT
EXPANSION OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES WAS NOT ENOUGH TO REACH THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH
LIBRARIES. THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK HAD PREVENTED GENUINE DECENTRALISATION
AND POPULARISATION OF CULTURE. LIBRARIES WITH RIGID MANAGEMENT AND DEMAND FOR
QUALIFIED STAFF WERE PREVENTING THEIR USE AS LOCAL CULTURE CENTRES. SOLUTIONS
INVOLVING GREATER COORDINATION WITH OTHER LOCAL ACTIVITIES WERE OFFERED.
AGAINST THIS MORTENSEN ARGUES THAT THE 1964 LIBRARY ACT PROMOTED
DECENTRALISATION AND THAT LIBRARIES MORE THAN OTHER INSTITUTIONS ARE REACHING
THE BROAD POPULATION. WARNS AGAINST REDUCTION OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES IN ORDER
TO HELP THE GRASS ROOTS MOVEMENTS. LOCAL AUT HORITIES NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE
STATE FOR LIBRARY SERVICES. THE DEBATE THAT FOLLOWED AND THE REPLY FROM THE
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION'S CHAIRMAN STRESSED THAT LIBRARIES WERE NOT UNDER ATTACK.
