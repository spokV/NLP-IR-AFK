(PHD THESIS-SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY.) EXAMINES THE USER OF SDI SYSTEMS. THE DATA
THUS OBTAINED DO NOT SUPPORT THE CURRENT MODEL RELATING TO THE IDENTIFYING OF
USERS AND USES OF SDI SERVICES, AND EXPOSE THE MODEL AND ITS THEORETICAL
FRAMEWORK AS BEING TOO NARROW, EXCLUDING SEVERAL SEGMENTS OF THE USER
COMMUNITY. DEVELOPS AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL BASED ON MASS COMMUNICATION THEORY
AND INCORPORATING SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION THEORY. THE NEW MODEL IDENTIFIES
THE CLIENTS OF SDI SERVICES AS A CLUSTER OF SOCIAL ACTORS, EACH PERFORMING
SOME TASK IN OBTAINING AND USING SDI SERVICES.
