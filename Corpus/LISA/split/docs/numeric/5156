DESCRIBES RESULTS OF A SURVEY PUBLISHED IN MAY 81 ON THE STAFFING SITUATION
AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN WEST GERMAN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, INCLUDING' GENERAL
INFORMATION ABOUT THE 670 PARTICIPATING LIBRARIES; POSTS AVAILABLE IN THE
VARIOUS SERVICE GRADES; DIVISION OF POSTS BETWEEN THE MAIN WORK SPHERES;
VACANT POSTS; TEMPORARY POSTS; NEW POSTS CREATED IN 1979 AND 1980; PLANNED
CHANGES IN STAFFING. THE SURVEY WAS INTENDED TO SHOW THE VARYING SITUATIONS IN
DIFFERENT JOB GRADES AND IN DIFFERENT REGIONS AND TO GIVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF
PROMOTION PROSPECTS. HOPES OF IMPROVING SALARIES IN CERTAIN STATES, ESPECIALLY
HESSE AND HAMBURG, HAVE BEEN DASHED BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION
BUT THE SURVEY HAS PROVIDED USEFUL INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD STIMULATE FURTHER
DISCUSSION.
