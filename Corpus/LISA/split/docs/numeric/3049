DISCUSSES ISSUES RAISED IN CURRICULUM PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT FOR A
POSTGRADUATE COURSE IN INFORMATION SCIENCE. CONSIDERS INFORMATION SCIENCE AS
AN INTERDISCIPLINARY SUBJECT AREA CONCERNED WITH THE EFFICIENT COMMUNICATION
OF ITS SUBSTANTIVE NUCLEUS, INFORMATION. ACCORDINGLY, TEACHING PROGRAMMES ARE
REQUIRED TO COVER BOTH ACADEMIC INSTRUCTION AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION, WITH
THE CURRICULUM ITSELF SERVING AS A MODEL OF EFFICIENT COMMUNICATION. THE
QUESTION THEN NECESSARILY ARISES WHETHER COURSES SHOULD BE ORIENTED TOWARDS
INSTILLING THE EXISTING CORPUS OF COGNITIVE INFORMATION, OR IN DEVELOPING
CAPABILITIES FOR DEALING WITH PRESENT AND FUTURE NEEDS. WHEREAS ACADEMIC
TRAINING EMPHASISES THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH, PROFESSIONAL TRAINING REQUIRES
PREPARATION FOR DECISION MAKING. PROPOSES IN CONCLUSION A MODEL OF CURRICULUM
ORGANISATION ENCOMPASSING BOTH THEORY AND APPLICATION.
