ARE COUNTY LIBRARIES THREATENED?.
     
THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT REPORT NOU 1979 PROPOSES THAT FROM 1981 STATE GRANTS
TOWARDS COUNTY ADMINISTRATION SHOULD CEASE, BEING REPLACED BY ADDITIONAL TAX
INCOME. THE INTENTION IS TO SIMPLIFY LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL STRUCTURE AND
INCREASE THE COUNTIES' ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTONOMY.
CONCENTRATING ON TECHNICAL DETAILS, THE REPORT IGNORES THEIR EFFECT ON
PROFESSIONS AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE AREAS CONCERNED. CULTURAL WORK IS DEFINED AS
A VOLUNTARY ACTIVITY FOR COUNTIES, NOT REQUIRING OR MERITING STATE SUPPORT;
LIBRARIES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ALREADY UNDER SOME DEGREE OF STATE SUPERVISION.
STATE SUPPORT HAS BEEN A STIMULUS TO CULTURAL LIFE IN RURAL AREAS, AND ITS
REMOVAL WOULD BE A RETROGRADE STEP. THE PROPOSALS, IF IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT
FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY, COULD
LEAD TO GREATLY VARYING STANDARDS OF LIBRARY SERVICE IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES,
ALSO AFFECTING SCHOOLS AND ADULT EDUCATION. THIS WOULD BE DI RECTLY COUNTER TO
THE 'EQUALITY PRINCIPLE' IN THE CURRENT LIBRARY ACT.
