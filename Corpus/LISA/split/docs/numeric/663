LOCAL GOVERNMENT LIBRARY PLANNING AND ITS DEVELOPMENT FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF
GENERAL ADMINISTRATION.

AS LONG AS THERE ARE NO LIBRARY LAWS GUARANTEEING FINANCIAL PROVISION, PUBLIC
LIBRARIES WILL BE COUNTED AMONG THE 'VOLUNTARY' RESPONSIBILITIES OF LOCAL
GOVERNMENT, WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED IN TIMES OF RECESSION. LIBRARY
PLANNING IS DESCRIBED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF GENERAL MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION,
INCLUDING THE IMPORTANCE OF ESTABLISHING PRIORITIES AND OF LIBRARY COOPERATION
WITH OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE CONCERNED WITH
ORGANISATION, PERSONNEL AND FINANCE. MANY IMPORTANT PROBLEMS MUST BE SOLVED
BEFORE NEW PROJECTS CAN BE CARRIED OUT AND POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES MUST BE
TESTED.
