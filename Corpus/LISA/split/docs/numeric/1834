BOOK REVIEWS AS AIDS TO BOOK SELECTION.
     
A SMALL SURVEY HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT AT LEICESTER UNIVERSITY TO FIND OUT WHAT
SOURCES OF INFORMATION ACADEMICS IN SCIENCE DEPARTMENTS USE WHEN SELECTING
BOOKS FOR PURCHASING BY THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. INFORMATION WAS PARTICULARLY
REQUIRED ABOUT THE ROLE OF BOOK REVIEWS. WHILE RARELY GIVING FIRST INFORMATION
ABOUT A BOOK SUITABLE FOR PURCHASE, BOOK REVIEWS ARE READ REGULARLY BY A 1/3
OF THE STAFF OF THE DEPARTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE SURVEY.
