THE UTILIZATION OF AGRINDEX IN THE CARIBBEAN.
     
A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE INFORMATION HABITS AND NEEDS OF
THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCHES IN THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES OF THE CARIBBEAN
REGION WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE USE OF AGRINDEX. THE SURVEY REVEALED
THAT AGRINDEX IS USED BY AND KNOWN TO ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS AND
POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS ARE DISCUSSED. FROM ALL INDICATIONS IT SEEMS THAT
THERE IS A NEED FOR AN INFORMATION SERVICE WHICH WOULD PROVIDE ABSTRACTS AND
REVIEWS OF REGIONAL AGRICULTURAL LITERATURE AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON RESEARCH
IN PROGRESS. TWO RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE; ONE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A USER
EDUCATION PROGRAMME WHICH WOULD ENSURE WIDER USE OF AGRINDEX AND THE SECOND
FOR A SUB-REGIONAL CO-ORDINATION CENTRE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES.
