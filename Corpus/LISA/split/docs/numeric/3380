SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION OF FICTION IN THE HOLON MUNICIPAL LIBRARY (IN HEBREW).
     
FORMER ATTEMPTS TO CLASSIFY FICTION CONCENTRATED ON LITERARY GENRES AND ONE
SUCH ATTEMPT IN THE ROSKILD, (DENMARK) LIBRARY IS BRIEFLY REVIEWED. THE HOLON
LIBRARIANS DECIDED TO BUILD A SUBJECT CATALOGUE FOR FICTION WHICH CAN BE
READILY USED BY READERS AS WELL AS LIBRARIANS. A BASIC LIST OF SUBJECTS WAS
DRAWN UP AND ADDITIONAL ONES ADDED AS WORKS OF FICTION WERE PROCESSED. IT WAS
FOUND THAT SOME FICTION CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED BY SUBJECT, WHILE OTHER WORKS
RECEIVE 2 OR MORE SUBJECT CARDS. THE CLASSIFICATION WAS CARRIED OUT IN 2
STAGES; AT FIRST ONLY BOOKS CURRENTLY RECEIVED WERE CLASSIFIED, AND LATER THE
EXISTING FICTION COLLECTION WAS PROCESSED IN THE SAME FASHION. THE LISTS OF
SUBJECT HEADINGS IN HEBREW AND ENGLISH ARE APPENDED.
