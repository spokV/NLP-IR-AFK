LIBRARY RESEARCH.
     
THE LIBRARY RESEARCH PROGRAMME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
SCIENCE OF TAMPERE UNIVERSITY DATES FROM 1976. THE AREAS FOR RESEARCH ARE'
LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIETY; PRODUCTION OF INFORMATION AND
ITS USERS; STORAGE SYSTEMS; AND ADMINISTRATION AND PLANNING. THESE TEND TO BE
LIBRARY ORIENTED RATHER THAN USER/COMMUNITY ORIENTED. FUTURE PROGRAMMES SHOULD
IDENTIFY PROBLEMS NOT OFFER SOLUTIONS. PERHAPS IT WOULD BE MOST FRUITFUL TO
SEE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AS A PART OF SOCIOLOGY. THE NEW POST OF
ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT.
