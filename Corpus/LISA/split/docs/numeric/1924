FILE AS A DEPENDABLE ARCHIVIST.
     
THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART OF INFORMATION PROCESSING TENDS TO LINK CERTAIN
CAPABILITIES (SUCH AS PROTECTION OF DATA INTEGRITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY AND
MONITORING USER/DATA INTERACTIONS) WITH LARGE DATA BASE SYSTEMS. THIS IS MOST
UNFORTUNATE, SINCE SUCH CAPABILITIES ARE FREQUENTLY VITAL FOR MODEST
APPLICATIONS WHICH DO NOT HAVE THE DEGREE OF DATA COMPLEXITY TO JUSTIFY THE
USE OF LARGE DATA BASE SYSTEMS AND WHICH MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEM.
DESCRIBES AN EFFORT TO BRIDGE THIS GAP IN CURRENT ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING
TECHNOLOGY BY MEANS OF A NEW LINGUISTIC CONCEPT OF FILES WHICH IS DESIGNED TO
SIMULATE A DEPENDABLE ARCHIVIST RATHER THAN A PASSIVE FILING CABINET.
