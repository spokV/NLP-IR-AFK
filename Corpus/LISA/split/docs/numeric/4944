REGIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
     
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DYNAMIC DEVELOPMENT IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, GREATER
ATTENTION HAS BEEN TURNED TO REGIONAL AND LOCAL PROBLEMS RECENTLY. MEMBERS OF
THE GOVERNING BODIES MUST THEREFORE BE KEPT ABREAST OF THE LATEST INFORMATION
ON THEIR REGIONS TO BE ABLE TO RUN THEIR ECONOMY SMOOTHLY AND TO PURSUE THE
CORRECT CULTURAL AND OTHER POLICIES. THUS DEPARTMENTS OF LOCAL HISTORY IN
LIBRARIES, AND THOSE IN THE CENTRAL DISTRICT LIBRARIES IN PARTICULAR, HAVE THE
DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO BUILD UP APPROPRIATE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES. IN
ADDITION TO BOOKS, DAILY PAPERS AND PERIODICALS, NON-BOOK MATERIALS SUCH AS
RECORDS, TAPES, DOCUMENTARY FILMS, SLIDES, PHOTOS AND PICTURE POSTCARDS HAVE
BECOME RATHER SIGNIFICANT. AS TO CONTENTS, MATERIALS HAVE TO BE SIFTED VERY
CAREFULLY TO GIVE A COMPREHENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS, EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENT
IN THE RELEVANT REGION.
