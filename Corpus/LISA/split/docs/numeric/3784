EURO-AMERICAN CONFLICTS IN THE SPHERE OF TRANSBORDER DATA FLOW (TDF).
     
THE CONFLICTS AND POSSIBILITIES FOR THEIR SOLUTION WITHIN THE AREA OF
TRANSBORDER DATA FLOW BETWEEN THE USA AND THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY ARE
STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR TO THOSE WITHIN THE AREA OF MASS-MEDIA BETWEEN THE
INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES AND THE THIRD WORLD. THE AUTHOR CALLS FOR REDEFINITION OF
THE EUROPEAN INTERESTS AND COMMENCEMENT OF POLITICAL AUTONOMY, AS WELL AS A
CERTAIN AND CLEARLY DEFINED DISSOCIATION OF EUROPE FROM THE USA, COMPARABLE TO
THE OBJECTIVELY DIFFERENT INTERESTS OF EUROPE IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY AND
ENERGY POLITICS. THE DISSOCIATION FROM THE USA IS PROPOSED LAST BUT NOT LEAST
IN ORDER THAT EUROPE REMAINS CREDIBLE VIS-A-VIS THE THIRD WORLD IN THE
MASS-MEDIA DEBATE.
