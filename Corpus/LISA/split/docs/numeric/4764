THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ETK IN INFORMING ITS PARTNER INSTITUTES ABOUT ITS
SERVICES.
     
SINCE 1979, THE HUNGARIAN BUILDING INFORMATION CENTRE (ETK) HAS BEEN PREPARING
ANALYTICAL DESCRIPTIONS ON ITS SERVICES AS PART OF THE FRAMEWORK OF
COOPERATION WITH ITS PARTNER INSTITUTES. THEY HAVE EITHER BEEN PUBLISHED IN
THE INFORMATION BULLETIN OF THE PARTNER INSTITUTES OR USED AS BASIC MATERIAL
FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PLANNING. REVIEWS PUBLICATIONS COMPLETED SO FAR.
