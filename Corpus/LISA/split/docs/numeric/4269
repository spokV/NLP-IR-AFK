LANGUAGE BARRIERS, LITERATURE USAGE AND THE ROLE OF REVIEWS' AN INTERNATIONAL
AND INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDY.
     
EXAMINES THE LANGUAGES IN WHICH PRIMARY AND REVIEW LITERATURE IS READ BY DUTCH
AND UK NATURAL SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, AND SOCIAL SCIENTISTS. COMPARES THE
NATURE OF THE LANGUAGE BARRIERS EXPERIENCED AND INVESTIGATES THE ROLES OF
TRANSLATIONS AND REVIEW ARTICLES IN OVERCOMING THESE BARRIERS. CONCLUDES THAT
IN SUBJECTS WHERE IMPORTANT NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE PRIMARY LITERATURE EXISTS,
GREATER RESOURCES SHOULD BE INVESTED IN THE IDENTIFICATION, TRANSLATION, AND
PUBLICATION IN ENGLISH OF GOOD-QUALITY NON-ENGLISH REVIEW ARTICLES WHICH GIVE
EXTENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NON-ENGLISH PRIMARY LITERATURE.
