LIBRARIES AFTER THE XVI COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS.

PROSPECTS AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAJOR LIBRARY NETWORKS IN SLOVAKIA
ARE BRIEFLY OUTLINED FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS. ALTHOUGH THE PAST DECADE PROVED TO
BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PERIOD IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, A NEW SCHEME FOR A PUBLIC
LIBRARY NETWORK IS ENVISAGED INCLUDING SEVERAL DISTRICT CULTURAL CENTRES AS
WELL AS THE NECESSARY STRUCTURAL CHANGES. IN-SERVICE COURSES FOR INFORMATION
SCIENTISTS MUST BE OFFERED ON A LARGER SCALE THAN BEFORE AND THE COOPERATION
OF SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES SHOULD
BE STRENGTHENED. YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELPED BY SCHOOL LIBRARIES WHICH OUGHT
TO BE FULLY INTEGRATED INTO THE WHOLE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS STARTING AT PRIMARY
SCHOOLS. MANUAL WORKERS, LABOURERS AND YOUNG APPRENTICES CAN BE ATTRACTED TO
TRADE UNION LIBRARIES BY A GREAT VARIETY OF LIBRARY GAMES, QUIZES AND
COMPETITIONS. INFORMATION WORKERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PLAY A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN
THE COMECON INFORMATION SYSTEM A S WELL AS CONTRIBUTING TO THE INTERNATIONAL
DINFORM.
