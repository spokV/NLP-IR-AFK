THE FUNDAMENTALS OF UAP.

THE AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION IS VITAL FOR ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, EDUCATIONAL AND
PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT. INFORMATION IS AT PRESENT AND FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE
LARGELY CONTAINED IN PUBLICATIONS. A NUMBER OF FACTORS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO AN
INCREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR PUBLICATIONS, BUT MANY NEDCS REMAIN UNMET. THE
DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF SERVICES BY PUBLISHERS, THE BOOK TRADE,
LIBRARIES AND OTHER TYPES OF INFORMATION SERVICE REQUIRES INTELLECTUAL AND
FINANCIAL COMMITMENT, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PLANNING BASED ON VALID AND
RELIABLE DATA, COORDINATION AND COOPERATION, AND WILL REQUIRE ACTION BY
GOVERNMENTS, PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS.
