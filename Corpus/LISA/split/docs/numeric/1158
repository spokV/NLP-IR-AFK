TRADITIONAL MEASURES OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES' AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS.

INVESTIGATES THE INTER-RELATIONSHIPS AND POSSIBLE MEANINGS OF THE TRADITIONAL
MEASURES OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN ORDER TO (1) UNDERSTAND THE
INTER-RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN
TRADITIONALLY MAINTAINED BY LIBRARIES, IDENTIFYING THOSE THAT ARE REDUNDANT
AND THOSE THAT ARE UNIQUE; (2) DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF EACH OF THESE MEASURES
ON ALL OTHER MEASURES; AND (3) UNDERSTAND THE VALIDITY OF THESE MEASURES,
SINGLY OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHERS, AS INDICATORS OF LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS.
THE DATA USED IS THAT COLLECTED IN THE 1974 US PUBLIC LIBRARIES SURVEY, WHICH
ASKED FOR DATA ON 60 MEASURES.
