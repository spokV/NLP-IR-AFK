INFORMATION PROCESSING NETWORKS IN INTERNATIONAL BANKING.
     
DURING THE PAST DECADE THERE HAS BEEN INCREASING CONCERN OVER THE SOCIAL,
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL IMPACTS OF INTERNATIONAL COMPUTERISED INFORMATION
NETWORKS. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST 3 LEVELS OF SUCH
NETWORKS, EACH WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASINGLY GREATER SOCIAL OR
ORGANISATIONAL IMPACT. BASED ON THAT CATEGORISATION, INTERNATIONAL BANKING WAS
CHOSEN AS THE FOCUS FOR AN ATTITUDE SURVEY CONCERNING THE PERCEIVED EFFECTS
AMONG BANKERS OF USING INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS. RESULTS INDICATE THAT TELEX IS
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT FOR DAILY INTERNATIONAL BANKING OPERATIONS THAN COMPUTER
NETWORKS, ALTHOUGH WITHIN 6 YEARS COMPUTER NETWORKS ARE EXPECTED TO REPLACE
TELEX IN IMPORTANCE.
