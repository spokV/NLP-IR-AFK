A PERSONAL VIEW OF THE ZAMBIA LIBRARY SERVICE.

PERSONAL VIEW OF THE SERVICE, BASED ON OBSERVATIONS MADE DURING WORK UNDER THE
VOLUNTARY SERVICES OVERSEAS SCHEME. IN KASAMA, THE PROVINCIAL CENTRE OF THE
NORTHERN PROVINCE, 3 MAJOR PROBLEMS FACED LIBRARY SERVICES-POOR TRANSPORT; THE
LEGACY LEFT BY AN ACTING LIBRARIAN WHO HAD OPERATED HIS OWN KIND OF LIBRARY
SERVICE WHICH WAS EXTREMELY CONFUSED ; AND THE LACK OF PROVISION FOR THE
PRACTICAL TRAINING OF NEWLY QUALIFIED STAFF. IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO BE MADE TO
THE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF AUTHORITY, DEVELOPMENT, TRANSPORT, TRAINING,
PROFESSIONAL STATUS AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES.
