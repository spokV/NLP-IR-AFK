TEACHING AND TRAINING FOR ON-LINE WORK IN LIBRARIES.
     
FINAL REPORT OF A PROJECT WHICH EXAMINED THE METHODS OF TEACHING AND TRAINING
RELATING TO ON-LINE WORK IN LIBRARIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO COST. THE COST
OF USING OUTHOUSE DATA BASES (LOCKHEED DIALOG AND BLAISE MARC) WITHIN
PROGRAMMES DESIGNED TO MAKE MAXIMUM USE OF INHOUSE PACKAGES WAS INVESTIGATED.
INHOUSE PROGRAMMES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PRACTICE WORK-THE BLAISE EDITOR WOULD BE
PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE TO USE. SOFTWARE FOR HANDLING MARC WAS FOUND TO BE
GENERALLY INADEQUATE. THE HEWLETT-PACKARD 2645A DISPLAY STATION WAS FOUND
ACCEPTABLE FOR TRAINING PURPOSES.
