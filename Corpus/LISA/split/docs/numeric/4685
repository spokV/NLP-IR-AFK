MANAGEMENT-BY-OBJECTIVES APPLIED IN A SOUTH AFRICAN INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY.
     
MANAGEMENT-BY-OBJECTIVES IS SUGGESTED AS A MEANS TO JUSTIFY THE EXISTENCE OF
AN INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICE. THE PREREQUISITES ARE THAT THE
INDUSTRIAL LIBRARIAN MUST GRASP THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A
SERVICE FUNCTION OPERATES IN INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THESE
FUNCTIONS. HE MUST ALSO ACQUAINT HIMSELF WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF THE
ORGANISATION HE SERVES AND ARRANGE HIS SERVICES TO MAKE A DEFINABLE
CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE ORGANISATIONAL OBJECTIVES. THE
OBJECTIVES OF THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS MUST BE USED AS PREMISES FOR
DETERMINING WHERE THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION FUNCTION SHOULD OPERATE AND HOW
ITS SERVICES SHOULD BE PRESENTED. THE INFORMATION SERVICE (WHICH CONSISTS OF 3
SECTIONS, A LIBRARY, TRANSLATION BUREAU AND INFORMATION DISSEMINATION) OF THE
SOUTH AFRICAN IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION (ISCOR) IS USED AS A
WORKING EXAMPLE. THE USE OF MBO BY ISC OR IS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED AND THE
OBJECTIVES OF ISCOR AND ITS GENERAL MANAGER ARE MENTIONED. FROM THESE
OBJECTIVES AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY ARE DERIVED AND IDENTIFIED IN THE FORM OF
THE DIFFERENT ISCOR DEPARTMENTS.
