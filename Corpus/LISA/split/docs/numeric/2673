LONG-TERM PLANNING' AN IMPORTANT TASK IN LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
LONG-TERM PLANNING IS VITAL TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND HAS BEEN A FEATURE OF
SOVIET LIBRARIANSHIP SINCE THE 1ST 5-YEAR PLAN. DISCUSSES THE METHODOLOGICAL
ASPECTS ONLY. THE PURPOSE OF LIBRARY PLANNING CAN BE DEFINED AS 'THE CREATION
OF THE OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR SATISFYING READERS' REQUIREMENTS AND OVERCOMING
INCONSISTENCIES IN THE READING HABITS OF DIFFERENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC GROUPS'. THE
PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN SUCH PLANNING INCLUDE POLITICAL COMMITMENT AND A
SCIENTIFIC BASIS, AND THERE IS A TENDENCY NOW TO USE A WIDE RANGE OF LOGICAL,
STATISTICAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS TO PRODUCE THE REQUIRED MODEL.
