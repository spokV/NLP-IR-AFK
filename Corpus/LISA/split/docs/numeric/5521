SUBJECT LIBRARIES IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC'S LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AS
EXEMPLIFIED BY TECHNICAL LIBRARIES.

THE ASSOCIATIONS' SECTIONS ARE COMPOSED OF SPECIALISED SUBJECT AND ACADEMIC
GENERAL LIBRARIES WITH RELEVANT STOCKS IN THE SUBJECT AREA CONCERNED. THEY AIM
TO DEVELOP COOPERATION, THE OPTIMAL USE OF LITERATURE, EDUCATION AND EXCHANGE
OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES. THE TECHNICAL SECTION IS THE LARGEST, WITH 318
MEMBERS. TECHNICAL LIBRARIES STOCK MAINLY MODERN MATERIAL; THEIR STAFF MEMBERS
ARE FEW, THEIR OPENING HOURS ARE RESTRICTED AND THEIR RESEARCH RESULTS ARE
OFTEN INACCESSIBLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THEY ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH A
SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE AND PROVIDE SPECIFIC INFORMATION SOURCES WHICH PLAY
SUBORDINATE ROLES IN OTHER LIBRARIES. THE TECHNICAL LIBRARY SECTION IS
CURRENTLY CONCERNED WITH LIBRARY AND INFORMATION WORK IN FACTORY COMBINES,
PROBLEMS OF PATENT LITERATURE AND LIBRARY WORK IN TECHNICAL COLLEGES WITHIN
INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXES.
