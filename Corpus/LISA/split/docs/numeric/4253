INFORMATION USES IN SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS.
     
A PAPER DELIVERED AT THE 1979 IRFIS CONFERENCE IN OSLO, REPORTING A
USER-EVALUATION STUDY OF A CURRENT AWARENESS BULLETIN PRODUCED FOR SOCIAL
SERVICES STAFF, CARRIED OUT IN THE COURSE OF A MAJOR INVESTIGATION INTO
INFORMATION NEEDS IN UK SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF DATA
COLLECTION PROCEDURE, AND RESULTS PRESENTED IN FULL, WITH TABLES. FROM DATA
OBTAINED ON TYPES OF INFORMATION CONSIDERED RELEVANT; CASE STUDY MATERIAL ON
SPECIFIC PROBLEMS USING A CRITICAL INCIDENT APPROACH; AND INFORMATION ON USE
OF THE BULLETIN AND COPIES OF JOURNAL ARTICLES, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE
SCALE AND GENERALITY OF THE SOCIAL WELFARE FIELD ARE SO GREAT THAT AN SDI
SERVICE WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR MOST PEOPLE.
