RESEARCH, LITERATURE, AND A RICH MARRIAGE. LIBRARY HISTORICAL PORTRAITS (2).

A PORTRAIT OF PETER FREDERIK SUHM, 1728-98, AUTHOR OF A HISTORY OF DENMARK. HE
OPENED HIS PRIVATE LIBRARY IN HIS HOUSE IN CENTRAL COPENHAGEN TO THE PUBLIC
AND PEOPLE FROM ALL SPHERES OF LIFE USED IT. LITTLE IS KNOWN OF THIS LIBRARY
AS CATALOGUES, CORRESPONDENCE, INVOICES AND RECORDS OF BORROWINGS WERE LOST.
ALTHOUGH 1 OF SUHM'S LIBRARIANS, R. NYERUP, WAS A PROLIFIC AUTHOR, HE NEVER
WROTE ABOUT THE LIBRARY. WITH 100,000 VOLUMES, IT WAS LARGER THAN THE
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. SUHM SPENT 5 TIMES AS MUCH ON HIS LIBRARY AS THE
GOVERNMENT SPENT ON THE ROYAL LIBRARY, NOT YET OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, AND PAID
FOR IT WITH HIS WEALTHY WIFE'S MONEY. 2 YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH THE LIBRARY WAS
SOLD TO THE ROYAL LIBRARY.
