AUTHOR COCITATION: A LITERATURE MEASURE OF INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE.

SHOWS THAT THE MAPPING OF A PARTICULAR AREA OF SCIENCE, IN THIS CASE
INFORMATION SCIENCE, CAN BE DONE USING AUTHORS AS UNITS OF ANALYSIS AND THE
COCITATIONS OF PAIRS OF AUTHORS AS THE VARIABLE THAT INDICATES THEIR
'DISTANCES' FROM EACH OTHER. THE ANALYSIS ASSUMES THAT THE MORE 2 AUTHORS ARE
CITED TOGETHER, THE CLOSER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM. THE RAW DATA ARE
COCITATION COUNTS DRAWN ON-LINE FROM SOCIAL SCISEARCH (2SOCIAL SCIENCES
CITATION INDEX1) OVER THE PERIOD 1972-79. COCITATION ANALYSIS OF AUTHORS
OFFERS A NEW TECHNIQUE THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF
INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE IN THE SCIENCES AND POSSIBLY IN OTHER AREAS TO THE
EXTENT THAT THOSE AREAS RELY ON SERIAL PUBLICATIONS.
