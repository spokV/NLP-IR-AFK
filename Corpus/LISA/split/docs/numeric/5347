BY ULM UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.

IN ADDITION TO THE MAIN CATALOGUES FOR MONOGRAPHS AND PERIODICALS, FOR THE

FOR REFERENCE STOCK, INCLUDING BIBLIOGRAPHIES, MONOGRAPHS AND PERIODICALS AND
ARRANGED IN 3 SECTIONS' AN ALPHABETICAL AUTHOR/TITLE CATALOGUE; A KEYWORD
CATALOGUE; AND A CLASSIFIED LOCATION CATALOGUE. ULM HAVE DEVISED THEIR OWN
SYSTEM, DESCRIBED IN DETAIL, FOR DETERMINING KEYWORD GROUPS AND NOTATION
STRUCTURE. ADVANTAGES OF THE SPECIAL CATALOGUE ARE' IT LISTS MONOGRAPHS AND
PERIODICALS TOGETHER; PERIODICALS ARE GIVEN A SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION; THE
NOTATION IS EASIER TO REMEMBER THAN THAT USED IN THE MAIN CATALOGUE; THE
KEYWORDS ARE IN GERMAN; THE SHELF ARRANGEMENT PRODUCED BY USING THE NOTATION
IS SUITED TO THE STOCK.
