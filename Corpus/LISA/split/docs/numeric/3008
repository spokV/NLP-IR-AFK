REGISTRATION OF HUNGARIAN DRUGS, ITS UTILITY FOR THEIR REGISTRATION IN FOREIGN
COUNTRIES.
     
THERAPEUTIC VALUE AND SIDE-EFFECTS OF, AND NECESSITY FOR DRUGS IN HUNGARY ARE
SUPERVISED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PHARMACY, WITH CIRCULATION AUTHORISED
BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH. REGISTRATION IS CARRIED OUT BY THE NATIONAL
INSTITUTE, WHICH ALSO DETERMINES THE QUALITATIVE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PRODUCT
AND CONFIRMS THE FACTORY'S USE AND DOSAGE INSTRUCTIONS. DRUG DOCUMENTATION IS
HANDED OVER AFTER PRECLINICAL AND CLINICO-PHARMACOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS, AND
INCLUDES ANTECEDENTS OF THE ACTIVE AGENTS AND VEHICLES, AND DATA ON TOXICITY,
AND CARCINOGENIC AND MUTAGENOUS PROPERTIES. REGISTRATION IS AN IMPORTANT
FACTOR FOR EXPORT-MOST COUNTRIES REGISTER HUNGARIAN DRUGS ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE
BEEN REGISTERED ALREADY IN HUNGARY. FOREIGN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CIRCULATION OF
A DRUG REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE ON REGISTRATION PRESCRIPTIONS IN THE PARTNER
COUNTRIES.
