THE TEACHER AND THE MEDIA CENTRE-PROBLEMS AND DISTURBANCES IN USE.
     
THE FUNCTIONS AND ORGANISATION OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES/MEDIA CENTRES AS
INDISPENSIBLE PREREQUISITES FOR THE REALISATION OF EDUCATIONAL AIMS HAVE BEEN
DISCUSSED SINCE THE 1970S, BUT LIBRARIANS' HIGH EXPECTATIONS HAVE GENERALLY
NOT BEEN REALISED. EVEN IN COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS, MEDIA CENTRES ARE STILL ONLY
ON THE FRINGE OF SCHOOL LIFE. THE USE OF A MEDIA CENTRE AS A FOCAL POINT OF
SCHOOL ACTIVITIES DEMANDS RADICAL CHANGES IN SCHOOL STRUCTURE AND THE
TEACHER'S ROLE. MANY OF THE MEDIA PROVIDED ARE UNSUITED TO THE SCHOOL LEARNING
SITUATION. TEACHERS HAVE TO SPEND MUCH TIME PLANNING THE DEVELOPMENT OF
INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMMES; CLOSE COOPERATION WITH SCHOOL LIBRARIANS WOULD
PROVE HELPFUL HERE. ADMINISTRATION OF CENTRALLY STORED MEDIA IS EFFECTIVE AND
ECONOMICAL BUT SINCE MUCH TIME IS WASTED WHEN CHILDREN MOVE BETWEEN CLASSROOM
AND MEDIA CENTRE, FLEXIBLE TIMETABLES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED.
