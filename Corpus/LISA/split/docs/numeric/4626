WORK BEGAN ON A NEW CATALOGUE. THIS CATALOGUE OFFERS PRIMARILY EDITING, WITH
DESCRIPTIONS OF CONDITION, DATING AND TEXTUAL CHARACTERISTICS. IT IS ARRANGED
IN 2 MAIN SECTIONS' (1) LITERARY TEXTS; (2) OFFICIAL AND PRIVATE LETTERS, EACH
SECTION BEING SUBDIVIDED INTO EDITED AND UNEDITED WORKS. INITIAL MANUSCRIPT
PREPARATION SHOULD BE COMPLETED AT THE END OF 1981.
