THE SITUATION IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). DISCUSSION ON
PLR IS MUCH FURTHER ADVANCED IN CANADA THAN IN THE USA-AUTHORS' AND
LIBRARIANS' GROUPS HAVE ISSUED RESOLUTIONS AND MANIFESTOES; FORMAL DEBATES
HAVE BEEN HELD; AND THE CANADA COUNCIL (A GOVERNMENTAL CORPORATION WHICH
ADMINISTERS GRANT PROGRAMMES FOR ARTISTS AND AUTHORS) IS DEVELOPING A MODEL
FOR COMPENSATING AUTHORS, BASED ON HOLDINGS OF THEIR WORKS BY LIBRARIES. GIVEN
THE PRESENT POLITICAL CLIMATE IN THE USA, PLR ISSUES ARE NOT AS TIGHTLY DRAWN
THERE. MOST US LIBRARIANS ARE ONLY DIMLY AWARE OF PLR, BUT MILITANCY AMONG
PROFESSIONAL AUTHORS IS GROWING.
