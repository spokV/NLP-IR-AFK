PLANS FOR AN ON-LINE CATALOG AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS.
     
THE INCREASING SIZE, COST, AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CARD CATALOGUE HAS CAUSED THE
LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN TO BEGIN PLANNING
FOR AN ON-LINE PUBLIC CATALOGUE. THE LIBRARY HAS DECIDED TO USE THE SOFTWARE
OF THE WASHINGTON LIBRARY NETWORK (WLN) AS THE BASIS FOR AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE
WHILE CONTINUING TO USE OCLC AS A SOURCE OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS. THE PLANS
FOR REPLICATING THE WLN SOFTWARE AT ILLINOIS AS AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE AND THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS FOR STATEWIDE RESOURCE SHARING ARE DISCUSSED.
