INTELLIGENT TERMINALS FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION WORK.
     
DISCUSSES THE NATURE OF INTELLIGENT TERMINALS, THEIR USEFUL FACILITIES, AND
THEIR POSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT, WITH SPECIAL REGARD TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF
THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION COMMUNITY. SECTION 1 DEALS WITH THE CURRENT BASIC
TERMINAL AND THEN ELABORATES ON THE FACILITIES WHICH MAY BE ADDED TO IMPROVE
ITS INTELLIGENCE, SUCH AS INTERNAL MEMORY, ENHANCED DISPLAY, MULTIPLE
PERIPHERALS, IMPROVED COMMUNICATIONS ABILITY, SOPHISTICATED CONTROL
FACILITIES, AND PROGRAMMABILITY. THE FACILITIES ARE DESCRIBED AND SOME IDEA OF
THEIR UTILITY IS GIVEN. THE USES OF THE TERMINAL ARE DISCUSSED IN AREAS SUCH
AS INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, CATALOGUING, TRAINING, DATA ENTRY, AND LIBRARY
HOUSEKEEPING. USEFUL FACILITIES OF AN INTELLIGENT TERMINAL ARE OUTLINED AND
EXAMPLES GIVEN. THE FUTURE IS CONSIDERED UNDER THE HEADINGS OF HARDWARE,
SOFTWARE, AND NETWORKING DEVELOPMENT. HERE PROJECTIONS ARE MADE FOR THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE TERMINALS AND THEIR USE FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS.
