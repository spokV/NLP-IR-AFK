WHAT BOOKS DO PEOPLE NEED?.

SINCE LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES ARE WELL EDUCATED, THERE IS ALWAYS A DANGER THAT
THEY MAY CATER SOLELY FOR THE WISHES OF AN ELITE MINORITY AND, BY EXCLUDING
EPHEMERAL LITERATURE FROM STOCK, DISCOURAGE MANY OTHER PEOPLE FROM USING THE
LIBRARY. THE WEST GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY PLAN OF 1973 STATES CLEARLY THAT
LIBRARIES MUST CATER FOR EVERYONE, EVEN IF PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY LIMITED
BUDGETS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT EMPHEMERAL LITERATURE HAS A RELAXING
EFFECT ON MANY PEOPLE, IN CONTRAST TO THE STIMULATING EFFECT CAUSED BY MORE
DEMANDING WORKS. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO EXCLUDE LESS VALUABLE
MATERIAL, SUCH AS WORKS INVOLVING PORNOGRAPHY AND VIOLENCE AND THEN TO INCLUDE
SOME TRIVIA IF CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF READER STRUCTURE DEMANDS IT.
