A CRITICAL SURVEY OF UNION CATALOGUES IN UNIVERSITIES.
     
EFFORTS MADE SINCE THE MID 19TH CENTURY TO PRODUCE ALPHABETICAL UNION
CATALOGUES OF ALL BOOKS WITHIN A UNIVERSITY HAVE BEEN HAMPERED BY THE
DIFFICULTY OF ACCESS TO SOME INSTITUTE LIBRARY STOCKS, BY INACCURATE
CATALOGUING IN INSTITUTE LIBRARIES AND BY THE QUESTIONABLE VALUE OF A CENTRAL
CATALOGUE WITHIN PURCHASING POLICY. SINCE 1970, HOWEVER, PROFESSIONAL OPINION
HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY IN FAVOUR OF UNION CATALOGUES IN UNIVERSITIES; WORK IN
THIS FIELD AT VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES IS DESCRIBED AND EVALUATED THROUGH ANALYSIS
OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN FIGURES. THESE CATALOGUES SHOULD BE PRODUCED ONLY WHEN
CERTAIN CONDITIONS PREVAIL, E.G. WHEN INSTITUTE STOCK SUBJECT COVERAGE IS MUCH
WIDER THAN THAT OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARY, WHEN ACCESS TO THE UNION CATALOGUE IS
EASY AND WHEN THE CATALOGUE CAN BE PRODUCED WITHOUT DETRIMENT TO OTHER WORK.
