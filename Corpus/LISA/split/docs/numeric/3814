AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM OF SEMANTIC INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION.
     
THE PRINCIPLES OF CONSTRUCTING AN AUTOMATED ADAPTIVE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BASED ON A SEMIOTIC MODEL ARE CONSIDERED. THIS MODEL
DERIVES FROM THE SAME PRINCIPLES AS THOSE UNDERLYING RELATIONAL LANGUAGES OF
FACET AND BLOCK CLASSIFICATIONS. THE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS AND DISTRIBUTION OF
DOCUMENTS, THE GENERAL TECHNOLOGICAL SCHEME OF THE SYSTEM, AND ALGORITHMS OF
ITS BASIC CIRCUIT ARE DESCRIBED. THE POSSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION OF A
SEMIOTIC MODEL TO SDI IS DEMONSTRATED.
