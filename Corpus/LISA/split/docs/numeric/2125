THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC PRESENTATION OF GREY LITERATURE.
     
THE PRIMARY COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH CENTRE, LEICESTER, UK, WAS COMMISSIONED TO
STUDY THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC PRESENTATION OF GREY LITERATURE AND PREPARE BASIC
GUIDELINES FOR PRESENTATION IN A FORM CAPABLE OF BEING WIDELY ADVERTISED AND
USED WITHIN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY. FINDINGS INDICATE CONSIDERABLE
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION OFFERED BY GREY
LITERATURE; A NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE USE OF COLOUR (ESPECIALLY ON COVERS)
AND BINDING; AND A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN THE DESIRE FOR
GUIDELINES-DOCUMENT RETRIEVERS SEE A NEED FOR GUIDELINES, WHEREAS
REPORT-PRODUCERS SEE THE PRESENT SITUATION AS ADEQUATE AND DO NOT READILY
ACCEPT THE NOTION OF GUIDELINES.
