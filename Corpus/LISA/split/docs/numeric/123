RECENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND DEVELOPMENT TRENDS IN ARCHIVES IN AFRICA SOUTH OF THE
SAHARA AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE EXPATRIATE RESEARCHER.

DISCUSSES PUBLICATIONS BY AND ABOUT AFRICAN ARCHIVES SOUTH OF THE SAHARA
ISSUED DURING THE LATE 1950S AND 1960S; THE GROWTH IN SUCH PUBLICATIONS AND
JOURNAL ARTICLES DURING THE 1970S; THE PROGRESS IN AFRICAN ARCHIVAL
DEVELOPMENT DURING THE 1970S; THE INCREASED CONTROL OF ACCESS TO ARCHIVAL
COLLECTIONS; THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE RETURN OF AFRICAN ARCHIVES FROM FORMER
COLONIAL RULERS; AND THE MICROFILMING OF AFRICAN ARCHIVES. THESE DEVELOPMENTS
WILL HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON EXPATRIATE RESEARCHERS, WHO SHOULD SUPPORT THE
DEVELOPMENT GOALS OF AFRICAN ARCHIVISTS IN WHICHEVER WAYS POSSIBLE.
