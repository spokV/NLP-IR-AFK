OPTIMIZING THE EVALUATION OF CALCULUS EXPRESSIONS IN A RELATIONAL DATABASE
SYSTEM.
     
THE TGR EXPERIMENTAL RELATIONAL DATA BASE SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED. ITS USE OF
MICROPROGRAMMED DATA BASE PRIMITIVES AND OPTIMISATION FEATURES IS INTENDED TO
INCREASE THE SPEED OF RETRIEVAL. THE FEEDBACK-OPTIMISATION STRATEGY IS
ILLUSTRATED USING 2-VARIABLE EXPRESSIONS AND ARBITRARY (MULTI-VARIABLE)
EXPRESSIONS. THE USE OF FILTERS AND THEIR RULES FOR CONSTRUCTION ARE
DESCRIBED, AND ILLUSTRATED IN THE CONJUNCTIVE NORMAL FORM. TGR IS BRIEFLY
COMPARED WITH DAMAS, AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION USING THE BCLP LANGUAGE DESCRIBED.
STATISTICS ON PERFORMANCE SHOW THAT THE FEEDBACK-OPTIMISATION IS BEST SUITED
FOR QUERIES INVOLVING MANY RELATIONS AND PERFORMANCE IS POOR WITH LARGE
RELATIONS, IT CANNOT THEREFORE BE USED AS A STAND-ALONE OPTIMISATION METHOD.
MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO SELECT THE RIGHT OPTIONS.
