EMILIA-ROMAGNA' PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR LIBRARIES.
     
A DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT SITUATION IN A NORTH ITALIAN PROVINCE, WHERE
SERVICES ARE UNCOORDINATED AND UNEVENLY DISTRIBUTED. DRAWING ON AN INDEPENDENT
SURVEY PUBLISHED IN 1979, GIVES DETAILS OF THE VARIOUS LIBRARY SYSTEMS IN
OPERATION, AT REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS' UNIVERSITY, CHURCH, SCHOOL, LOCAL AND
PRIVATE. THE INEQUALITY OF SERVICE PROVISION IS DEMONSTRATED, AND THE NEED FOR
A REGIONAL POLICY INVOLVING CREATION OF NEW LIBRARIES AND RATIONALISATION OF
EXISTING RESOURCES SHOWN. THE OPERATION OF URBAN LIBRARY SYSTEMS IN BOLOGNA
AND MODENA IS DESCRIBED, AND THE PROJECTED NETWORK SERVICE, BASED ON
DESIGNATED LIBRARY CONSORTIA, SUCH AS BOLOGNA-FERRARA, IS DISCUSSED. FINALLY
THE RELUCTANCE OF THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL LEGISLATION
FOR REORGANISING AND RESTRUCTURING LIBRARY SERVICES IS CONDEMNED AS THE ROOT
FACTOR INHIBITING NETWORK DEVELOPMENT.
