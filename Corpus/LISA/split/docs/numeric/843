FUTURE PLANS FOR THE ULSCS.

PAPER PRESENTED AT A ONE-DAY SEMINAR ON THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON SHARED
CATALOGUING SYSTEM, 3 APR 81. ULSCS IS MERELY A MEANS TO AN END-THAT BEING A
UNIVERSITY-WIDE NETWORK FOR RESOURCE SHARING IN LIBRARIES. THE SYSTEM WILL
PROVIDE MANY ELEMENTS NEEDED FOR A COOPERATIVE ACQUISITIONS PROGRAMME, A
SHARED DATA BASE TO WHICH ALL THE SYSTEM'S LIBRARIES WILL CONTRIBUTE, AND USER
ACCESS WITHIN THE LIBRARY AND ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT OF AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE. THE
SYSTEM SHOULD, HOWEVER BE SEEN IN ITS PLACE IN THE NATIONAL NETWORK, AND IT
WILL BE ACCESSED ALONG WITH THE MARC FILES AND SAVE A GEAT DEAL OF TIME.
