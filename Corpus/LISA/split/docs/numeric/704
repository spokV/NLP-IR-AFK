PREVENTING PUBLIC SEX IN LIBRARY SETTINGS.

PUBLIC LIBRARIES ATTRACT SUBSCRIBERS WHO USE THE LIBRARY IN BOTH LEGITIMATE
AND ILLEGITIMATE WAYS. ONE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS USING THE LIBRARY FOR
UNCONVENTIONAL PURPOSES ARE PUBLIC EROTICISTS WHO USE THE TOILETS AND OTHER
ACCESSIBLE AREAS FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES. RATHER THAN CONSUMER SECURITY TIME IN
TRYING TO ENTRAP AND/OR ARREST THESE INDIVIDUALS, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT
CHANGING SECURITY FUNCTIONING AND GOALS AND A FEW MINOR STRUCTURAL CHANGES
WILL DISCOURAGE MOST IF NOT ALL SUCH BEHAVIOUR.
