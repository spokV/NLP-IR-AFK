THE DYNAMIC PUBLIC LIBRARY.

A PRACTICAL DISCUSSION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY'S ROLE AS AN AGENT FOR SOCIAL AND
CULTURAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE COMMUNITY. TO ATTRACT READERS, THE LIBRARIAN MUST
DESIGN SERVICES TO MEET LOCAL NEEDS AND INTERESTS; HERE, CONTACT WITH LOCAL
COMMUNITY LEADERS IS ESSENTIAL. TO PROJECT A DYNAMIC IMAGE, SERVICES MUST BE
MANIFESTLY RELEVANT AND EFFICIENT, AND GEARED NOT ONLY TO EXISTING USERS BUT
ALSO TO NON-USERS. EMPHASISES THAT THE LIBRARY'S PRIORITY IS TO COUNTERACT
GENERAL PUBLIC APATHY BY BOLD INITIATIVES; SUGGESTS VARIOUS STRATEGIES FOR
DRAWING PUBLIC ATTENTION, AND CONCLUDES WITH A DETAILED PLAN FOR ORGANISING A
NATIONAL LIBRARY WEEK, ALONG THE LINES OF THE LATIN AMERICAN NATIONAL BOOK
WEEK, TO HIGHLIGHT PUBLIC LIBRARY ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES.
