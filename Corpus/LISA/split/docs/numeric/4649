LAESEFORENING (FEMININE READING SOCIETY) IN COPENHAGEN. THE LEADERS OF THE
SOCIETY, PARTICULARLY CHARLOTTE KLEIN, VIEWED IT AS AN EXTENSION OF ADULT
EDUCATION. THEY WERE CONSERVATIVE IN THEIR SELECTIONS BUT WERE AFFECTED BY
CHANGES IN DANISH SOCIETY, AND THEY GRADUALLY ACCEPTED REALIST LITERATURE. THE
SOCIETY BECAME ONE OF THE LARGEST WOMEN'S ORGANISATIONS IN SCANDINAVIA AND
LASTED FOR 90 YEARS.
