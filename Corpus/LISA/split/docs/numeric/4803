EVALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR DATA BASES IN AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES.
     
REPORT OF A STUDY COMPARING AGRICOLA, AGRIS AND CAB, INTENDED PRIMARILY TO
ESTABLISH SELECTION CRITERIA FOR USE AND ACQUISITION. REFERENCES WERE
RETRIEVED RELATING TO 11 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, BY EACH OF THE 3 DATA BASES
SINGLY, AND IN COMBINATIONS OF 2, AND COMPARED FOR DUPLICATION AND DIVERSITY.
DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF INITIAL HYPOTHESES, AND MATERIALS AND METHODS USED.
RESULTS ARE PRESENTED IN FULL, AND AN INDEX OF DUPLICATION CALCULATED, SHOWING
WHICH COMBINATION OF 2 OUT OF 3 DATA BASES IS THE MOST EFFICIENT. THE DATA
OBTAINED WERE ALSO USED TO INVESTIGATE PUBLICATION LANGUAGES AND COUNTIES OF
ORIGIN OF ARTICLES. REFINEMENTS OF THE METHODOLOGY USED ARE SUGGESTED.
