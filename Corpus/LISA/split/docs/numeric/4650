CONFUTATION OF THE ORTEGA HYPOTHESIS BY CITATION ANALYSIS. PART 1. A CASE
STUDY OF METHOD CRITICISM.
     
1ST PART OF A 2 PART STUDY WHICH PROVIDES A DETAILED CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF COLE
AND COLE'S PAPER (2SCIENCE, 1(178) 1972, 368-375) IN WHICH BY MEANS OF
CITATION INDEX ANALYSIS, THE AUTHORS CONFUTED THE ORTEGA Y GASSET HYPOTHESIS
OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS WHICH, THEY SAY, ATTRIBUTES MUCH OF THE GROWTH OF
SCIENCE TO THE WORK OF THE AVERAGE SCIENTIST WHO, IT IS SUGGESTED, HAS PAVED
THE WAY WITH HIS 'SMALL' DISCOVERIES FOR THE MEN OF GENIUS. THE CASE STUDY
POINTS OUT THE INCOMPETENT APPLICATION OF CITATION INDEX ANALYSIS AS A
RESEARCH METHOD.
