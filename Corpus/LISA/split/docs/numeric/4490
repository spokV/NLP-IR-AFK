PALAEOGRAPHY IN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVE.
     
TEXT OF A PAPER DELIVERED AT A SYMPOSIUM IN THE CUBAN NATIONAL LIBRARY IN
1978. THE COLLECTION UNTIL RECENTLY CONTAINED VERY LITTLE MANUSCRIPT MATERIAL
OF PARTICULAR INTEREST, AND NO STAFF WERE TRAINED IN SPANISH PALAEOGRAPHY. IN
1945 A GENERAL ARCHIVE TRAINING COURSE, WHICH INCLUDED PALAEOGRAPHY, WAS HELD,
USING PHOTOCOPIES OF ORIGINALS. SINCE 1959, MANY LONG-STANDING PROJECTS HAVE
BEEN REALISED, INCLUDING THE ACQUISITION OF LARGE MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS
DATING FROM THE 16TH CENTURY, CONTAINING IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS FOR THE STUDY OF
CUBA'S HISTORY. ACCORDINGLY, SINCE 1962, NEW TRAINING PROGRAMMES IN SPANISH
PALAEOGRAPHY HAVE BEEN INITIATED. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE NEW MATERIAL STILL
BEING ADDED TO THE ARCHIVE.
