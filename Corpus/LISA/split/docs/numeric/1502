LIBRARIES IN THE FAROE ISLANDS.
     
THE 1ST PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE FAROE ISLANDS (FAERO COUNTY LIBRARY, NOW CALLED
FOROYA LANDSBOKASAVN) WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1828. DESCRIBES ITS DEVELOPMENT
DESPITE MANY ACUTE PROBLEMS, DETERIORATION AFTER THE DEATH OF THE LIBRARIAN IN
1878, RECOVERY FROM 1920 (THANKS TO A NEW LIBRARIAN), AND MOVEMENT INTO A NEW
BUILDING IN 1980. OUTLINES THE FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE ISLANDS' PUBLIC
LIBRARIES AND GIVES FIGURES FOR STOCK, BORROWERS, AND LOANS. DRAWS ATTENTION
TO THE SITUATION OF THE FAROESE LANGUAGE-IT WAS NOT TAUGHT IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS
UNTIL THIS CENTURY; 80-100 BOOKS AND SOME SMALL PUBLICATIONS ARE PUBLISHED IN
FAROESE ANNUALLY; AND MOST PRINTED MATTER IS IN DANISH.
