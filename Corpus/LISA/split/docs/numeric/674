THERE IS STILL MUCH TO BE DONE.

CENTRALISATION IS PRACTICALLY COMPLETE IN RSFSR (RUSSIAN SOVIET FEDERATE OF
SOCIALIST REPUBLIC). IN 1980, 2,200 CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS, (CLS),
OPERATED IN RUSSIA, UNITING 50,000 LIBRARIES. BUT PROBLEMS OF ACQUISITIONS AND
STOCK-EXPLOITATION HAMPER CLS. MANY CENTRAL LIBRARIES COMPLAIN OF A
DETERIORATION OF ACQUISITIONS, ESPECIALLY OF FICTION AND CHILDREN'S
LITERATURE. BOOK-ORDERING DEPARTMENTS DO NOT FULFIL CLS ORDERS, BUT DUMP
UNWANTED BOOKS ON THEM. RELATIONS BETWEEN BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARIES NEED
OVERHAULING. BOOKSELLERS SHOULD BE REWARDED FOR FULFILLING LIBRARIES' BOOK
ORDERS. INCREASED FINES MAY PREVENT LOSS OF BOOKS. CLS NEED BINDING EQUIPMENT
FOR BOOK REPAIRS AND SHOULD IMPROVE BOOK USE BY INTRA-SYSTEM BOOK-EXCHANGE,
THUS IMPROVING SERVICE TO RURAL LIBRARIES. LIBRARIANS NEED HIGHER SPECIALISED
EDUCATION TO EQUIP THEM FOR READING-GUIDANCE.
