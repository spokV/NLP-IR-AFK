LEADERSHIP BY NONADMINISTRATORS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
     
LEADERSHIP BY THOSE NOT IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY IN LIBRARIES HAS USUALLY
BEEN DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATION IN MANAGEMENT. A NUMBER OF OTHER
MODELS ARE GIVEN' PARTICIPATION AND FEEDBACK MODELS, INCLUDING THE EVALUATION
OF SUPERIORS; MODELS OF CONFRONTATION AND RISK TAKING, INCLUDING ACTION TO
OVERCOME MISMANAGEMENT AND ASSERTION OF EMPLOYEES' RIGHTS; AND MODELS FOR
CHANGE AGENTS, INCLUDING USE OF STAFF ORGANISATIONS, INFORMAL ACTION NETWORKS,
AND RESOURCE EXCHANGE NETWORKS. THE THEORY IS THAT A 'SERVANT LEADERSHIP' BY
LOWER AND MIDDLE LEVEL STAFF MAY PROMOTE SERVICE BY LIBRARIES AND ALSO
INCREASE ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK TO THE STAFF THEMSELVES. THE
ACTION MODELS SHOULD BE TESTED AND RELATED TO A CAREER-STAGE MODEL WHICH
IDENTIFIES POWER AND INFLUENCE BY THOSE WHO ARE NOT MANAGERS.
