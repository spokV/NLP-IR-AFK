THE ART LIBRARY SCENE IN EGYPT.

ART LIBRARIES IN EGYPT, AS PART OF A BROADER ART INFORMATION CONTEXT, DO NOT
PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN THE PRESERVATION, SURVEY, AND DISSEMINATION OF ART
INFORMATION IN THE COUNTRY. THESE INFORMATION CENTRES LACK THE RECOGNITION AND
FINANCIAL SUPPORT NECESSARY TO ALLOW THEM TO BECOME ACTIVE, UP-TO-DATE ART
INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSES. DISCUSSES 2 MAJOR ART DOCUMENTATION CENTRES IN
CAIRO: THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM LIBRARY AND THE CRESSWELL COLLECTION AND LIBRARY AT
THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. IDENTIFIES COMMON PROBLEMS AMONG ART LIBRARIES AND
SUGGESTS STEPS WHICH COULD LEAD TO IMPROVED CONDITIONS.
