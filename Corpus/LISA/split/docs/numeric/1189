SALARY SURVEY OF HOSPITAL LIBRARIANS IN THE MIDCONTINENTAL REGIONAL MEDICAL
LIBRARY GROUP.

ANALYSES THE RESULTS OF A SALARY SURVEY OF HOSPITAL LIBRARIANS IN THE
MIDCONTINENTAL REGIONAL MEDICAL LIBRARY GROUP IN THE USA. THIS ANALYSIS SHOWS
THAT, WHILE BEING CERTIFIED BY THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OR HAVING A
MASTER'S DEGREE IN LIBRARY SCIENCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE A HIGH SALARY, THE 2
FACTORS DO TEND TO RAISE THE SALARY OF THE HOSPITAL LIBRARIAN. SUGGESTS A MODE
SALARY RANGE FOR HOSPITAL LIBRARIANS, AND EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT THE SURVEY'S
RESULTS WILL HELP TO ESTABLISH A BASE LINE FROM WHICH HOSPITAL LIBRARIANS CAN
DISCUSS SALARY STRUCTURES WITH ADMINISTRATORS.
