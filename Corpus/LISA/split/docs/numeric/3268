DOD SHOULD GIVE BETTER GUIDANCE AND TRAINING TO CONTRACTORS WHO CLASSIFY
NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION.
     
BECAUSE OF DEFICIENCIES IN GUIDANCE, TRAINING, AND INSPECTIONS, SOME NATIONAL
SECURITY INFORMATION HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED IMPROPERLY, BOTH OVERCLASSIFIED AND
UNDERCLASSIFIED, AND HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY MARKED TO PROTECT IT. GAO EVAULATED
CONTRACTOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLASSIFICATION PROGRAMME REQUIREMENTS OF
EXECUTIVE ORDER 12065 AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) BY VISITING 20
CONTRACTORS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND BY SENDING ABOUT 600 QUESTIONNAIRES TO
CONTRACTORS NATIONWIDE.
