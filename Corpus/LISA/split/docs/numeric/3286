UNGARIAN UNIVERSITY EDUCATION IS EXCLUSIVE, WITH OVER-RESTRICTIVE SPECIAL
SUBJECTS. AT SZEGED, AT THE FACULTY OF PHARMACOLOGY, ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE
TO TEACH STUDENTS HOW TO LEARN INDIVIDUALLY. PERSONAL CONSULTATIONS WERE
FOLLOWED BY SUBJECT ASSIGNMENTS, GRADED ACCORDING TO STUDENTS' LINGUISTIC
ABILITY. BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION, REFERENCE SOURCES AND LIBRARY USE WERE
TAUGHT, AND LITERATURE SEARCHES UNDERTAKEN, FOLLOWED BY ABSTRACTS TRANSLATION.
THE COURSE ASSISTED STUDENTS IN ALL ASPECTS OF LITERATURE PROCESSING.
