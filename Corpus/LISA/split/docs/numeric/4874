THE CATALOGUE OF AN 18TH CENTURY READING LIBRARY.
     
THE READING LIBRARIES WERE FORERUNNERS OF THE MODERN PUBLIC LIBRARY; THEY WERE
FOUNDED IN THE 18TH CENTURY, AT THE TIME OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT, AS
PROFIT-MAKING INSTITUTIONS BY MIDDLE-CLASS CITIZENS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND
RECREATIONAL PURPOSES. THE CATALOGUE OF 1 SUCH LIBRARY, DIE ARNOLDSCHE
BIBLIOTHEK IN BUDISSEN, 1799-1806, IS 1 OF THE RARE BOOKS IN THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY OF POTSDAM. COMPRISING A MAIN VOLUME AND 13 SUPPLEMENTS, IT LISTS
7,000 TITLES IN ACCESSION ORDER. THE LIBRARY STOCKED MAINLY FICTION FROM
GERMANY AND ABROAD, OF WHICH SOME WORKS HAVE NOW BECOME CLASSICS. THE FICTION
STOCK ALSO REFLECTED THE CONTEMPORARY ENTHUSIASM FOR TALES ABOUT MEDIAEVAL
CHIVALRY AND THE SUPERNATURAL. THERE WERE ALSO ABOUT 400 DRAMATIC WORKS AND
100 ON TRAVEL AND CONTEMPORARY HISTORY.
