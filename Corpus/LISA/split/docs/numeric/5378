QUANTITATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND NON-DESCRIPTORS IN THESAURI.

ABOUT 40 THESAURI OR COLLECTIONS OF SUBJECT TERMINOLOGY EQUIVALENT TO THESAURI
WERE STUDIED WITH REGARD TO QUANTITY RATIOS BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND
NON-DESCRIPTORS OR BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND A TOTAL VOCABULARY. WITH THE HELP
OF REGRESSION ANALYSIS, LINEAR CONNECTIONS WERE MADE WITH A STRONGLY
EMPHASISED CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTORS AND THE
NON-DESCRIPTORS. THEN THE NUMBER OF NON-DESCRIPTORS WAS FOUND TO INCREASE MORE
SLOWLY THAN THAT OF THE DESCRIPTORS, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE PROPORTION OF
NON-DESCRIPTORS TO THE TOTAL VOCABULARY DECREASES AS THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTORS
INCREASES. THE INIS THESAURUS (INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM) IS
DESCRIBED IN RELATION TO THIS THEORY AND FOUND TO BE WELL PRODUCED.
