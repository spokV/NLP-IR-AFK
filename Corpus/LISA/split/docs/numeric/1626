PUBLICATION RATE AS A FUNCTION OF LABORATORY SIZE IN THREE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH
INSTITUTIONS.
     
IN 3 BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF A SINGLE
LABORATORY SIZE AT WHICH THE NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS PER SCIENTIST IS MAXIMAL
OR MINIMAL. IN A SCATTERGRAM OF THE NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS OF A LABORATORY
AGAINST LABORATORY SIZE, THE HORIZONTAL COORDINATE MEASURES THE NUMBER OF
SCIENTISTS IN A LABORATORY, THE VERTICAL AXIS MEASURES THE NUMBER OF
PUBLICATIONS FROM THE LABORATORY (COUNTING EACH PUBLICATION ONCE REGARDLESS OF
THE NUMBER OF AUTHORS), AND EACH LABORATORY IS REPRESENTED BY ONE POINT.
SCATTERGRAMS FOR THE ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY (NEW YORK), THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE
FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH (LONDON), AND THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (BETHESDA)
ARE EACH DESCRIBED WELL BY A STRAIGHT LINE THROUGH THE ORIGIN. THE SLOPES OF
THE LINES FOR THE THREE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. IN THESE
LABORATORIES, RANGING IN SIZE FROM 1 TO 46 SCIENTISTS, ONE ADDITIONAL
SCIENTIST  INCREASES THE EXPECTED ANNUAL NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS OF A
LABORATORY BY APPROXIMATELY 1.1, REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF THE LABORATORY.
