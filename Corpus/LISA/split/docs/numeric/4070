AN ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF AN ENQUIRY, CARRIED OUT AMONG 4TH YEAR STUDENTS
OF ONE OF THESE SCHOOLS, AS TO STUDENTS' MOTIVATION, INFORMATION PROVIDED TO
THEM ON WHICH THEY BASED THEIR DECISION TO SELECT THIS VOCATION, WHICH BRANCH
OF LIBRARIANSHIP THEY ARE INTERESTED IN, AND HOW THEY ASSESS THEIR 4 YEAR

YEAR STUDENTS TAKE PART. THE COURSE IS COMPLETED BY FINAL EXAMINATIONS WHICH
