SERIAL CONTROL IN A DEVELOPED MACHINE SYSTEM.

ARGUES THAT THE DEVELOPED MACHINE SYSTEMS OF THE FUTURE WILL NOT BE BASED ON
PRESENT LINEAR MACHINE RECORDS, BUT WILL OPERATE UPON A COMPLEX NETWORK OF
SIMPLE RECORDS. SUCH A NETWORK WILL HAVE SPECIAL APPLICATION TO THE PROBLEMS
RELATING TO THE CONTROL OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ON SERIALS. THE PROBLEMS
OF CHRONOLOGICAL AND HIERARCHICAL LINKAGE OF SERIALS ARE ANALYSED AND RELATED
TO THE PROPOSED NEW SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL ALSO PROVIDE BENEFICIAL
EFFECTS FOR SERIALS CHECK IN, SERIALS CATALOGUING, AND CATALOGUE USERS.
