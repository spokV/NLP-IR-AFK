JOB MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION OF REFERENCE STAFF IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
ARGUES THAT DESPITE AUTOMATION, LIBRARY WORK WILL REMAIN LABOUR INTENSIVE; IT
IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL TO CONSIDER THE HUMAN ASPECT OF THE SITUATION,
PARTICULARLY IN REFERENCE WORK, WHERE IN GENERAL THE QUALITY IS LOW. TO
INVESTIGATE THE RELATION BETWEEN JOB MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION, A SURVEY WAS
CARRIED OUT AMONG ONTARIO REFERENCE LIBRARY STAFF, USING TECHNIQUES OF
ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENT ADAPTED FROM THE FIELD OF BUSINESS STUDIES. DETAILS
ARE GIVEN OF THE METHODOLOGY, QUESTIONNAIRE CONSTRUCTION, AND RATING
TECHNIQUES. RESULTS SHOWED GENERALLY MODERATE SATISFACTION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITIONS, BUT LOW MOTIVATION. THE INITIAL HYPOTHESIS, THAT PROFESSIONALS
WOULD EXPRESS GREATER MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION THAN NON-PROFESSIONALS, WAS
NOT CONFIRMED.
