THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SITUATION AND THE NATIONAL PERIODICAL CATALOGUE, (PART) 1'
UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE LIBRARY CENTRE.

IN 1954, A BIBLIOGRAPHIC JOINT COMMITTEE WAS SET UP, WHOSE TASK WAS TO
COORDINATE DANISH BIBLIOGRAPHIC PUBLISHING AND INITIATE BIBLIOGRAPHIES WHERE
NEEDED. IT WAS TO ADVISE THE LIBRARY CENTRE THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LONG TERM
PLANNING. IN REALITY, CONTROL WAS LEFT TO THE PUBLISHERS AND INITIATIVES FOR
NEW PUBLICATIONS TO INDIVIDUALS, INTERNATIONAL BODIES AND PRESSURE GROUPS.
THIS SITUATION IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE UNTIL THE LIBRARY COMMISSION'S PROPOSAL
FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUNCIL WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR
CONTROL OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND STATE FINANCING HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED.
AS LONG AS THE LIBRARY CENTRE HAS MONOPOLY ON PRODUCTION, IT CAN DICTATE THAT
LIBRARIES MUST PAY HIGH PRICES OR ELSE MAKE DO WITH FEWER AND INFERIOR
BIBLIOGRAPHIES. THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS THEREFORE CALLED FOR NATIONALISATION
OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY WITH FREE DISTRIBU TION TO LIBRARIES.
