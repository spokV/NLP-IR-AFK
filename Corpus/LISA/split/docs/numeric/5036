N.K. KRUPSKAYA AND CURRENT PROBLEMS IN THE ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY SERVICES TO
RURAL POPULATIONS.

RAISING THE CULTURAL LEVEL OF LIFE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE IS STILL A MAJOR TASK OF
SOVIET LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE 1980S. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAVE PRODUCED GREAT
QUANTITATIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN RURAL LIBRARY SERVICES, BUT QUALITATIVELY MUCH
STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE. N.K. KRUPSKAYA WAS CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH THIS VERY
PROBLEM IN THE 1930S AND HER RECOMMENDATIONS ARE STILL VALID TODAY. IF WHAT
SHE WROTE THEN CAN BE PUT INTO PRACTICE NOW, THE GAP BETWEEN THE LEVELS OF
SERVICE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY CAN BE RAPIDLY NARROWED.
