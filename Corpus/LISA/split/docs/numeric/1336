LITERATURE AVAILABLE ON THE SUBJECT OF ACQUISITION. MUCH OF THIS RESULTS FROM
SEMINARS AND CONFERENCES. 1 OF THE PROBLEMS ARISING IN THE AREA OF ACQUISITION

EXCHANGES. THE MECHANISATION OF ROUTINES, SUCH AS CATALOGUING AND ACCOUNTING
AND THE AUTOMATION OF BOOKSELLERS' DATA HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR ACQUISITION. NEW
TENDENCIES IN PUBLISHING, SUCH AS EXCLUSIVE PUBLICATION IN MICROFORM, CAN
CAUSE PROBLEMS OF CONTROL AND RETRIEVAL. THE PROBLEMS SURROUNDING PHOTOCOPYING
AND LENDING VERSUS PURCHASE ARE STILL BEING DEBATED.
