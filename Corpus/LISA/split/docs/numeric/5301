SOME ACQUISITION PROBLEMS IN BULGARIA.

THE SPECIAL COMMISSION FOR ACQUISITION COORDINATION, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT
TO FOREIGN PERIODICALS AND OTHER PUBLICATIONS, HAS BEEN IN OPERATION FOR MORE
THAN 20 YEARS. DURING THAT TIME, SEVERAL NATIONAL VENUES HAVE TAKEN PLACE
UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE COMMISSION TO KEEP LIBRARIANS ABREAST OF THE LATEST
DEVELOPMENTS, IN PARTICULAR IN THE FIELD OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF
PUBLICATIONS. 1 OF THE LATEST SEMINARS DEALT WITH COPYRIGHT PROBLEMS AFTER THE
WIDE INTRODUCTION OF MODERN REPROGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT. INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE HAS
BEEN FIRMLY ESTABLISHED IN MAJOR BULGARIAN LIBRARIES, INCLUDING THE CYRIL AND
METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY, THE BULGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES LIBRARY AND THE
UNIVERSITY OF SOFIA LIBRARY. EXCHANGE IS THE ONLY WAY TO REDUCE THE DEPLETIVE
EFFECT OF THE RAPIDLY GROWING PRICES OF WESTERN PERIODICALS AND BOOKS ON THE
FOREIGN CURRENCY ALLOWANCES AVAILABLE TO BULGARIAN LIBRARIES. THE COMMISSION'S
FOREMOST TASK IS TO REMOVE OBSTACLES A ND TO ENCOURAGE FURTHER POSITIVE STEPS
IN THIS IMPORTANT SECTION OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES.
