A FIRE IN THE DEBATE ABOUT THE NEW LIBRARY BILL.
     
DISCUSSES THE LIBRARY BILL PROPOSED BY THE DANISH CHRISTIAN PEOPLES' PARTY, A
MINORITY PARTY WHOSE PROPOSAL HAS NO CHANCE OF BECOMING LAW, BUT MIGHT YET
INFLUENCE THE RULING SOCIAL DEMOCRATS' PROPOSAL. THE C.P.P. SUPPORTS THE
LIBRARY COMMISSION'S MINORITY REPORT AND PREFERS THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE
ADMINISTERED BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS, WHILE RESEARCH, EDUCATIONAL
AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES COME UNDER THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION. BUT UNLIKE THE
MINORITY REPORT, IT SUGGESTS THAT NO NON-BOOK MATERIALS AND CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES SHOULD RECEIVE STATE SUPPORT, AND THAT IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE
INDIVIDUAL AUTHORITY WHETHER TO CHARGE FOR THESE OR FINANCE THEM OUT OF THE
LOCAL RATES. EXEMPTED FROM THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE LENDING OF AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIALS TO THE DISABLED. IT SUPPORTS THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY
AND ITS DECISIVE INFLUENCE ON BOOK SELECTION. A BLOCK GRANT SYSTEM OF
FINANCING WOULD ALSO AID LOCAL INDEPENDENCE.
