ON THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION FOR THE USE OF MICROELECTRONICS IN A FACTORY
COMBINE.

MICROELECTRONICS HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE OVER MOST CONTEMPORARY INDUSTRIAL
WORKING PROCESSES, INCLUDING NOT ONLY THE FLOW OF MATERIAL, ENERGY AND
INFORMATION BUT ALSO GENERAL ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT. THUS IT IS CLEAR
THAT THE STAFF OF SPECIALIST RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS HAVE A GREATER NEED THAN
EVER BEFORE OF A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF INFORMATION. EXAMPLES OF THIS NEED AND
SUGGESTIONS FOR ITS RATIONAL SATISFACTION ARE PRESENTED WITH REFERENCE TO
EXPERIENCES IN A STRIP STEEL FACTORY CONCERNING THE USE OF MICROELECTRONICS IN
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS, STATISTICS
AND MANAGEMENT. THE USE OF MICROELECTRONICS IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY; ITS
POTENTIAL IN LARGE SCALE INFORMATION STORAGE AND DISSEMINATION IS NOT YET
FULLY EXPLOITED.
