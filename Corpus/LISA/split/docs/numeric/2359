A SIMPLE NUMERIC FILING SYSTEM FOR 7.5- AND 15-MINUTE TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS' THE
MCLANE SYSTEM.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 43RD ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION OF PACIFIC COAST
GEOGRAPHERS, RENO, JUNE 80. UNTIL AUG 79, MINES LIBRARY, PART OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LIBRARY, RENO, ARRANGED ALL OF ITS US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
7&H-MINUTE AND 15-MINUTE TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS ALPHABETICALLY BY STATE AND
QUADRANGLE NAME, BUT ADJACENT QUADRANGLES ARE THEN NOT FILED TOGETHER. ALVIN
MCLANE, CONSULTANT, DEVISED A NEW SYSTEM' THE MCLANE SYSTEM' USING THE 2USGS
INDEX TO TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS1, EACH 15-MINUTE QUADRANGLE IS NUMBERED
CONSECUTIVELY FROM WEST TO EAST STARTING FROM THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE
STATE WITH NUMBER ONE, AND ASSIGNING NUMBERS TO QUADRANGLES REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN MAPPED. DESCRIBES THE ADVANTAGES AND FLEXIBILITY, AND
SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF THE SYSTEM. FOR A LOCAL OR REGIONAL COLLECTION,
THE INVESTMENT IN TIME IN SETTING UP AND USING THE SYSTEM WOULD BE MINIMAL AND
THE REWARDS OF EA SE OF ACCESSING AND FILING WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL.
