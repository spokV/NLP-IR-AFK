ACQUISITION OF HOMOGENEOUS PERIODICAL LITERATURE IN A SPECIALIST LIBRARY' COST
EFFECTIVENESS.
     
IDENTIFIES THE NEED TO ACQUIRE LITERATURE IN THE INTERACTIVE SUBJECTS OF THE
CENTRAL SUBJECT OF RESEARCH FOCUS IN A RESEARCH ORGANISATION. GIVES A
CRITERION TO IDENTIFY THE INTERACTIVE SUBJECTS AND THE METHODS TO ASSIGN
WEIGHTS TO THESE SUBJECTS RELATIVE TO THE CENTRAL SUBJECT. THESE WEIGHTINGS
DETERMINE THE CUT-OFF POINTS IN THE RANKED LISTS OF THESE SUBJECTS. SUCH A
PROCEDURE WOULD GIVE RISE TO A HOMOGENEOUS, COST EFFECTIVE PERIODICAL
COLLECTION IN A SPECIALISED RESEARCH ORGANISATION.
