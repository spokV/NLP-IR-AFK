THE AMERICAN TRUST FOR THE BRITISH LIBRARY.
     
THE AIMS OF THE AMERICAN TRUST FOR THE BRITISH LIBRARY WERE ORIGINALLY TO
ENABLE THE BL TO AUGMENT ITS HOLDINGS OF AMERICAN PUBLICATIONS FROM THE 1880S
TO THE 1950S AND TO REPLACE BOOKS STILL MISSING FROM WORLD WAR 2 LOSSES. THE
ROLE OF ATBL IN THE PROMOTION OF AMERICAN STUDIES IN THE UK IS DISCUSSED.
