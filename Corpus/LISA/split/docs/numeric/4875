REVIEWS ON MANUSCRIPT CATALOGUES.
     
SINCE 1945 69 VOLUMES OF MANUSCRIPT CATALOGUES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN WEST
GERMANY, MANY OF THEM FUNDED BY THE GERMAN RESEARCH SOCIETY. 236 INDIVIDUAL
REVIEWS OF THE MANUSCRIPT CATALOGUES APPEARED IN 61 JOURNALS. THESE WERE LOCAL
AND REGIONAL JOURNALS, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL JOURNALS AND SPECIALIST
SUBJECT JOURNALS. THE MAJORITY OF THE REVIEWS WERE IN GERMAN; THERE WAS LITTLE
RESPONSE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES EXCEPT FRANCE. THE MOST POPULAR FORMS OF REVIEW
WAS A REPORT WITH AN EVALUATION OR SHORT NOTES. THE MANUSCRIPT CATALOGUE
REVIEWS ARE OF INTEREST TO 4 MAIN GROUPS' THE AUTHOR, THE LIBRARIES
(ESPECIALLY THE MANUSCRIPT DEPARTMENTS), THE GERMAN RESEARCH SOCIETY WITH
THEIR LIBRARY DEPARTMENT AND SUB-COMMITTEE, AND THE PUBLISHERS.
