THE PHILOSOPHY OF RECORDING KNOWLEDGE.
     
ALTHOUGH MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT HOW MANKIND HAS RECORDED KNOWLEDGE, THE
QUESTION OF WHY RECORD KNOWLEDGE AT ALL HAS NOT BEEN TREATED SYSTEMATICALLY.
INFERENCES AND DEDUCTIONS FROM HISTORICAL RECORDING FORMATS LEAD TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT WHILE TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED THE ART OF RECORD KEEPING, THE
UNDERLYING PURPOSES HAVE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY THE SAME-TO COMMEMORATE,
COMMUNICATE, PRAY, CALCULATE, MEASURE, AND PRESERVE.
