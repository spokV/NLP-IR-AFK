A BROAD BACK AND A TERRIER'S HEAD: AN INTERVIEW WITH THE HEAD OF A LOCAL
VOLUNTARY LIBRARY.

IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONNICKENDAM IN THE NETHERLANDS A PUBLIC LIBRARY RUN
ENTIRELY BY UNPAID VOLUNTEERS WAS FOUNDED IN 1973. THE COLLECTION WAS STARTED
WITH THE PURCHASE OF A BANKRUPT STOCK OF BOOKS AT MINIMAL COST AND IS
PRESENTLY HOUSED IN A FORMER SCHOOL. IT NOW TOTALS 14,500 VOLUMES AND LOANS
HAVE RISEN FROM 10,163 IN 1973 TO 60,368 IN 1980. THE LIBRARY HAS SEPARATE
ADULT AND CHILDREN'S SECTIONS AND STAFF MAKE REGULAR VISITS TO LOCAL SCHOOLS.
IT HAS CLOSE LINKS WITH THE TOWN LIBRARY WITH WHICH IT IS PLANNED TO MERGE
FORMALLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE. MRS VAN DRIEL, HEAD OF THE LIBRARY, RECOGNISES
THE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION OF HER VOLUNTARY ASSISTANTS, ADDING THAT THE
ESSENTIAL QUALIFICATION OF A VOLUNTEER IS 'A BROAD BACK AND THE HEAD OF A
TERRIER'.
