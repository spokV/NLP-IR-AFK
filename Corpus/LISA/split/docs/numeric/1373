ONLINE PERIODICALS AT HULL COLLEGE OF HIGHER EDUCATION.

DESCRIBES THE OPERATION, WITHIN THE COLLEGE'S MULTI-SITE LIBRARY, OF AN
ON-LINE PERIODICALS CONTROL SYSTEM, DEVELOPED COMPLETELY IN-HOUSE, WHICH
REPLACED AN INEFFICIENT MANUAL SYSTEM. EACH SUBSCRIPTION RECORD HOLDS DETAILS
OF TITLE, ALTERNATIVE TITLE, LOCATION CODE AND SUBJECT CODE AND IS COMPOSED OF
FIXED-LENGTH FIELDS WITH A-CHARACTER ALPHANUMERIC CONTROL NUMBER. FIELDS
INCLUDE FREQUENCY, ISSUES PER VOLUME AND PRICE, AND EACH ENTRY MAY BE TERMED
'ALIVE' OR 'INACTIVE'. LIBRARY RECORDS WERE THEN CONVERTED TO MACHINE-READABLE
FORM AND MAY NOW BE SORTED BY LOCATION, TYPE AND SUBJECT/DEPARTMENT. THE
SIMPLE ACCESSIONING PROCEDURES ARE DETAILED. THE SYSTEM WHICH WENT LIVE IN JAN
81 IS PROVING VERY EFFICIENT IN THIS PARTICULAR COLLEGE SITUATION.
