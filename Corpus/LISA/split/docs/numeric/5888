IN JAN 80, AN AD HOC CONSORTIUM OF SOME 30 SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED COLLEGE AND
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES WAS FORMED TO INVESTIGATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A
REPLICATABLE ON-LINE PUBLIC ACCESS CATALOGUE. THE GROUP, CONDOC (CONSORTIUM TO
DEVELOP AN ON-LINE CATALOG), CAME INTO EXISTENCE BECAUSE MANY SMALLER ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES SAW THEIR ON-LINE CATALOGUE REQUIREMENTS AS DIFFERENT TO THOSE OF
LARGE RESEARCH LIBRARIES. CONDOC ALLOWED THE POOLING OF EXPERTISE. ITS 1ST
MEETING TOOK PLACE AT THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION MIDWINTER MEETING,
1980. DESCRIBES ITS WORK TO DATE.
