PUBLIC LIBRARY NEEDS FOR BLACKS' A PERSONAL VIEW.
     
IN SOUTH AFRICA IT OFTEN IS ALLEGED THAT BLACKS REQUIRE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY TO
OFFER SERVICES BY WHICH THEY CAN ADVANCE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND CAPABILITIES. ON
THE MASLOW PYRAMID THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED A NEED AT THE BASIC LEVEL, WHILE
THE READING OF RECREATIVE WORKS COULD BE CONSIDERED TO LIE AT A HIGHER LEVEL.
IN FACT IT IS FOUND THAT 72% OF BOOKS BORROWED BY BLACKS CONSIST OF FICTION.
IT MAY NOW BE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS ALREADY PASSED THE
BASIC READING LEVEL, OR WHETHER RECREATIONAL READING FORMS PART OF THAT LEVEL.
AS SOME 66% OF THE BLACK MEMBERSHIP OF A LIBRARY MAY CONSIST OF CHILDREN, THE
HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FICTION CIRCULATED RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER THESE
CHILDREN SEE LIBRARIES PRIMARILY AS SOURCES OF INFORMATION, AND ABOUT THE
SUITABILITY OF NON-FICTION PROVIDED. ONLY ABOUT 5% OF BLACKS USE AVAILABLE
LIBRARY FACILITIES. IT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE EDUCATIONAL APPROACH
IS NOT BEING OVER-STRESSED IN BLACK PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
