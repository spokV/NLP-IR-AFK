IF CONFIDENCE VANISHES IN THE FUTURE' STATE LIBRARY CENTRE, WHITHER GOEST
THOU?.
     
MOST STATE LIBRARY CENTRES, EXCEPT THOSE IN BAVARIA, NOW HAVE TO FACE
FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS, JUST AT A TIME WHEN INCREASES IN STOCKS AND SERVICES
ARE BADLY NEEDED. EVERYTHING THAT LIBRARY CENTRES HOPED FOR SEEMS THREATENED.
THE GERMAN TENDENCY TOWARDS PERFECTION APPLIES TO MEDIUM-SIZED RATHER THAN TO
SMALL ORGANISATIONS. THE INCREASED USE OF NON-BOOK MEDIA HAS CHANGED THE
CENTRES' ROLE. THE CENTRES HAVE PLAYED AN INVALUABLE PART IN DEVELOPING RURAL
LIBRARY SERVICES BUT THEIR GOLDEN AGE IS NOW PAST. LIBRARY POLICY COULD BE
ALTERED, HOWEVER, THROUGH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CENTRES' TASKS BY REGIONAL
LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS. THESE ASSOCIATIONS SHOULD BE FORMED IN AREAS WHERE NONE
EXIST; BASED ON A CONSTITUTION WORKED OUT BY LOCAL POLITICIANS, THEY CAN WORK
TOWARDS IMPROVING SERVICE QUALITY.
