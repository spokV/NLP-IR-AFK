A LIVING-ROOM FOR THE WHOLE TOWN.
     
A REPORT ON NAKSKOV NEW MAIN LIBRARY, A COMBINED PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARY.
THE 3190 SQ.M. AREA IS SPLIT UP BY SHELVES, MOVEABLE PARTITION WALLS AND 4
LARGE GARDEN AREAS. ALTHOUGH THE PRIME FUNCTION IS TO BE A PUBLIC LIBRARY, AN
AGREEMENT WITH THE ADJACENT EDUCATIONAL CENTRE, HOUSING COMMERCIAL, TECHNICAL
AND SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS, ALLOWS THE CENTRE USE OF THE LIBRARY AGAINST A
PAYMENT OF 300,000 KR. ANNUALLY TO BE USED PARTLY ON SALARY TO A LIBRARIAN. IT
IS HOPED THAT THE SPECIALISED MATERIAL TO BE ACQUIRED FOR THE STUDENTS WILL
ALSO BENEFIT THE PUBLIC AND THAT THE 130 SEAT THEATRE HALL WILL ATTRACT A
READY AUDIENCE FROM THE SCHOOLS. INTERVIEWS WITH LIBRARIANS REVEAL
DETERMINATION TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND BY PLACEMENT
OF THE EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT FURTHEST AWAY AVOID DOMINANCE BY THE STUDENT
USERS.
