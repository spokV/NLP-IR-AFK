INDEXING WITH NOMINAL PHRASES.

INDEXING WITH NOMINAL PHRASES IS A STRICT CONTINUATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT FROM
COORDINATE TO SYNTACTIC INDEXING. NOMINAL PHRASES ARE USER ORIENTED AND
ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR COMPLEX TERMS. A NOMINAL PHRASE CONSISTS OF A NUCLEUS
WITH A LEFT-HAND AND/OR RIGHT-HAND ATTRIBUTE. ATTRIBUTE AND NUCLEUS CAN OCCUR
SEVERAL TIMES AT THE SAME HIERARCHIC LEVEL. THE USE OF NOMINAL PHRASE INDEXING
IS ILLUSTRATED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF 3 MANUAL INDEXING SYSTEMS-TITUS, CASIN AND
GERDOK-AND 1 AUTOMATIC SYSTEM-DETECT. IN AUTOMATIC INDEXING WITH NOMINAL
PHRASES A COMPLETE SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS IS UNNECESSARY; EVEN SYSTEMS WITH
PARTIAL PARSING ROUTINES PRODUCE ACCEPTABLE RESULTS. THE PROBLEM OF RETRIEVAL
WITH NOMINAL PHRASES IS STILL UNSOLVED.
