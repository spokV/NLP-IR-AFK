CHILDREN, LIBRARIES AND COMICS IN MEXICO.

DESCRIBES A VISIT TO MEXICO AND THE US FINANCED BENJAMIN FRANKLIN LIBRARY IN
GUADELAJARA BRIEFLY. THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY ATTACHED TO THE 'CENTRO SOCIAL
MORELOS' IN AGUASCALIENTES SUFFERS FROM LACK OF SPACE AND MATERIAL, AND THE
UNQUALIFIED LIBRARIAN'S MAIN DUTY IS TO KEEP ORDER. FEW PUBLIC LIBRARIES LEND
BOOKS. THE STREAM OF PULP MAGAZINES AND COMICS FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN IS NOW
BEING COUNTERED BY THE STATE, WHO PUBLISHES MATERIAL IN SIMILAR STYLE, BUT
BETTER CONTENT. THE LIBRARY IN SAN CRISTOBAL RECEIVES MONEY FOR STAFF SALARIES
BUT NONE FOR BOOKS. LIKE OTHER LIBRARIES, BIBLIOTECA DE MEXICO IS USED MAINLY
BY STUDENTS. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE CAME ON A MORE ORGANISED FOOTING IN
1978, AND AS NO SCHOOL LIBRARIES EXIST, CREATION OF CHILDREN'S SECTIONS IS
RECEIVING PRIORITY. THERE IS GREAT DEMAND FOR THE LIBRARIANS TRAINED AT THE 6
UNIVERSITIES BUT MANY ARE ATTRACTED INTO PRIVATE FIRMS. CONTINUITY OF LIBRARY
PLANNING IS HAMPERED BY THE CHANGES OF  CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION EVERY 6 YEARS.
