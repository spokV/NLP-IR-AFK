SEARCHING BIASES IN LARGE INTERACTIVE DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.
     
THE WAY THAT INDIVIDUALS CONSTRUCT AND MODIFY SEARCH QUERIES ON A LARGE
INTERACTIVE DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IS SUBJECT TO SYSTEMATIC BIASES SIMILAR
TO THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN EXPERIMENTS ON JUDGMENTS UNDER
UNCERTAINTY. THESE BIASES ARE SHARED BY BOTH NAIVE AND SOPHISTICATED SUBJECTS
AND CAUSE THE INQUIRER TO CONSTRUCT AND MODIFY QUERIES INEFFICIENTLY. A
SEARCHING ALGORITHM IS SUGGESTED THAT HELPS THE INQUIRER TO AVOID THE EFFECT
OF THESE BIASES.
