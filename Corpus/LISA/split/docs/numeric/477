LIBRARY JOURNAL AND CHOICE: A REVIEW OF REVIEWS.

DISCUSSES THE METHODS BY WHICH LIBRARY JOURNAL AND CHOICE CHOOSE BOOKS FOR
REVIEW AND THEIR REVIEWERS. PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A COMPUTERISED CONTENT
ANALYSIS OF 1,300 REVIEWS FROM EACH JOURNAL, RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM ISSUES
PUBLISHED IN 1978. CONCLUDES THAT KEY DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THE EDITORS RATHER
THAN THE REVIEWERS; REVIEWS ARE RELATIVELY UNCRITICAL; THERE IS LITTLE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REVIEWS BY COLLEGE TEACHERS AND THOSE BY LIBRARIANS; AND
THAT UNSIGNED REVIEWS ARE NO MORE CRITICAL THAN SIGNED ONES.
