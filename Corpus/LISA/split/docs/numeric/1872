A KNOWLEDGE-BASED LITERATURE GUIDE SYSTEM-A NEW APPROACH TO DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL.
     
PRESENTS A NEW APPROACH TO DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL BASED ON A SEMANTIC MODEL FOR
NATURAL LANGUAGE. THE CONTENT OF A DOCUMENT IS REPRESENTED USING THE
HIERARCHICAL MODEL OF KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION, ITS SENTENCES BEING TRANSLATED
INTO LOGICAL REPRESENTATIONS WHICH ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE KNOWLEDGE BASE AS
AN ORGANISED KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURE. QUERIES ARE ALSO IN NATURAL LANGUAGE, FROM
WHICH RETRIEVAL COMMANDS ARE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED. ANSWERS ARE SYNTHESISED
FROM THE RESULTS OF RETRIEVAL. A WORKING SYSTEM CALLED LGS (LITERATURE GUIDE
SYSTEM) HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED. THIS CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS BASED ON THE
INTEGRATED ABSTRACTS OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. EXAMPLES USING LGS ARE
PRESENTED.
