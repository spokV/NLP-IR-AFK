SCATTERING OF METAL CUTTING INFORMATION.
     
PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A STUDY OF THE SCATTERING OF ARTICLES AND INFORMATION
IN THE FIELD OF METAL CUTTING (BASED ON THE 1972-73 ANNUAL VOLUME OF THE
SOVIET ABSTRACTING JOURNAL ON METAL CUTTING MACHINES AND TOOLS). DETERMINES
THE CONCENTRATION OF RELEVANT INFORMATION AND SHOWS THAT EXCLUSION OF
SCATTERED PUBLICATIONS LEADS TO SUBSTANTIAL INFORMATION LOSS.
