AUTHORS AND NAMES' MULTIPLE PSEUDONYMS IN AACR2.
     
THE HISTORY OF CATALOGUING PSEUDONYMS IS REVIEWED. AACR2 REVERSES A
CENTURY-LONG CATALOGUING PRACTICE BY ALLOWING AUTHORS WHO USE SEVERAL
PSEUDONYMS TO BE ENTERED IN THE CATALOGUE UNDER EACH NAME. THIS VIOLATES THE
CATALOGUE'S OBJECTIVES AS FORMULATED BY LUBETZKY AND IS CONTRADICTORY TO
AACR2'S OWN INTERNAL LOGIC. THE NUMBER OF DISADVANTAGES TO THIS RULE FAR
OUTWEIGH ANY ADVANTAGES. IT SHOULD BE REPLACED.
