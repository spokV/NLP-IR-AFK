ON THE USE OF 'GROSS WEIGHT FORMULAE' OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS FOR RETRIEVAL OF
INFORMATION ABOUT ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.
     
THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THE GROSS WEIGHT FORMULAE OF CHEMICAL COMPOUND BONDS
AS FILTERS WHEN RETRIEVING INFORMATION ON INDIVIDUAL CHEMICALS AND COMPOUND
CLASSES IS CHECKED. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INDEXING AND RETRIEVING COMPOUNDS
ACCORDING TO GROSS WEIGHT FORMULAE AND SOME FRAGMENTAL CODES IS COMPARED. THE
EASE OF AUTOMATIC CREATION OF GROSS-WEIGHT FORMULAE, THEIR GOOD
DIFFERENTIATING CAPABILITY, AND THEIR EXPEDIENCE WHEN RETRIEVING INFORMATION
IN LARGE FILES ARE STRESSED.
