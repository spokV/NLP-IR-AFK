SOUTH AUSTRALIAN LAND INFORMATION SYSTEM.
     
THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN LAND INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPRISES A SERIES OF SEPARATE
BUT INTEGRATED SUB-SYSTEMS OF VARYING DEGREES OF AUTOMATION AND ENCOMPASSING
LAND AND PROPERTY EVALUATION, LAND TAXING, WATER AND SEWERAGE RATING, LAND
OWNERSHIP AND TENURE, MAPPING, AND CADASTRAL COORDINATION. MAJOR CURRENT
DEVELOPMENTS ARE ON-LINE SYSTEMS FOR LAND OWNERSHIP AND TENURE (LOTS) AND
COORDINATION OF ALLOTMENTS (CLOTS). LONGER TERM DEVELOPMENTS RELATE MAINLY TO
THE CLOSER INTEGRATION OF THESE 2 AND THE EXTENSION OF LOTS TOWARDS AN
AUTOMATED REGISTRATION, INDEXING AND ENQUIRIES SYSTEM (ARIES), LEADING
ULTIMATELY TO A COMPUTERISED LAND TITLE.
