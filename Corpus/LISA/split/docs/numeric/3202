FOR AMERICAN LIBRARIANS TRADE UNIONS ARE NOT A GREAT ATTRACTION.
     
INTERVIEWS MARION PORRO, PRESIDENT OF THE TRADE UNION FOR LIBRARY EMPLOYEES IN
NEW YORK. THE ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY EMPLOYEES IN THE USA HAS NOT BEEN VERY
SUCCESSFUL AND TODAY ONLY ABOUT 10% OF EMPLOYEES, MOSTLY IN THE LARGE URBAN
PUBLIC LIBRARIES, ARE UNION MEMBERS. THIS IS, HOWEVER, IN LINE WITH THE
GENERAL SCEPTICISM TOWARDS THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT AMONG AMERICANS IN GENERAL
AND THE PROFESSIONS IN PARTICULAR. THE ALA HAS ON THE WHOLE HAD AN AMBIGUOUS
ATTITUDE TO TRADE UNION MATTERS. THE TRADE UNION IN NEW YORK, THE NEW YORK
LIBRARY GUILD, OR LOCAL 1930, ESTABLISHED IN 1968, HAS ABOUT 1500 MEMBERS AND
ALMOST TOTAL COVERAGE. IT NEGOTIATES 2 YEARLY AGREEMENTS ON PAY AND CONDITIONS
AND DEALS WITH GRIEVANCES, BUT DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE LIBRARY
PROFESSIONAL DECISION-MAKING. ON A WIDER FRONT, THE UNION IS ENGAGED IN
VARIOUS SOCIAL PROTEST MOVEMENTS, BUT NO COOPERATION WITH OTHER TRADE UNIONS
FOR LIBRARY EMPLOYEES TAKES PL ACE.
