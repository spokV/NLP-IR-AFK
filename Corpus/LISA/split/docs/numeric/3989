THE AUTOMATED OFFICE: ONLINE ACCESS IN A RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
     
DURING THE INTRODUCTION OF WORD-PROCESSING EQUIPMENT THE PROBLEM OF INDEXING
AND RETRIEVING THE PROCESSED DOCUMENTS AROSE. THE RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
ALLOWS THE ON-LINE INDEXING OF RECORDS, WHILE THE THESAURUS CAN BE CONSULTED
ON-LINE AS WELL. SECRETARIES ARE ABLE TO CREATE THEIR OWN DEPARTMENTAL
THESAURUS BY SELECTING THE RELEVANT TERMS FROM THE CORPORATE THESAURUS.
