THE FACT DATABASE: A SYSTEM BASED ON INFERENTIAL METHODS.
     
THE FACT DATA BASE (A MODEL FOR A NEW TYPE OF INFORMATION-HANDLING SYSTEM) IS
DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF ITS MAIN DATA STRUCTURE (BUILT FROM UNITS OF INFORMATION
CALLED 'FACTS') AND ITS CONCEPTUAL SECTION WHICH MANIPULATES THE STRUCTURE
(THE FACT MACHINE). ITS NOVELTY ARISES FROM ITS INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURE-A
MODEL OF THE REAL WORLD DESCRIBED BY THE DATA BASE AND REPRESENTATION OF
INFORMATION FED TO THE MACHINE. THIS, AUGMENTED BY INFORMATION ABOUT SET
MEMBERSHIP, ENABLES THE SYSTEM TO USE INFERENTIAL METHODS IN MANY ASPECTS OF
ITS OPERATION. SHOWS HOW THESE FEATURES LEAD TO A SIMPLE, FLEXIBLE INTERFACE,
BOTH TO OTHER COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND TO 'USER FRIENDLY' QUERY LANGUAGES.
