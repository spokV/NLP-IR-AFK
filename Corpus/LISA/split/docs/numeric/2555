INSTRUCTION TAPES FOR THE HP2645A.
     
THE AIMS OF THE PROJECT TEAM WERE TO INVESTIGATE THE FACILITIES OF THE HP2645A
TERMINAL, AND TO DEMONSTRATE ITS POTENTIAL AS A TEACHING TOOL, PARTICULARLY IN
RELATION TO THE TEACHING OF CATALOGUING. TWO TRIAL TAPES WERE PRODUCED TO RUN
ON THE TERMINAL. ONE WAS A PROGRAMMED TEXT ON CHAPTER 21 OF AACR2 (CHOICE OF
MAIN ENTRY), AND THE OTHER WAS AN INTRODUCTION TO MARC CATALOGUING. THE REPORT
DESCRIBES THE TAPES AND THE REACTIONS TO THEM OF A GROUP OF LIBRARIANSHIP
STUDENTS.
