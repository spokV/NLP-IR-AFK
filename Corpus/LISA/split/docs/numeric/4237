RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT BY HEURISTIC INFORMATION.
     
AFTER A REVIEW OF HEURISTICS AND HEURISTIC INFORMATION SOME ASPECTS OF MISSION
ORIENTED INFORMATION ARE DEALT WITH FROM THE LIBRARIAN'S VIEWPOINT.
INFORMATION STAFF SHOULD BE AWARE THAT RELEVANT INFORMATION MAY BE LOCATED BY
SEARCHING FIELDS OTHER THAN THE USER'S SPECIALITY. IN ADDITION TO THE
TRADITIONAL SOURCES, AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH ASSISTS IN THE EXPLOITATION
OF SUCH MATERIALS AS REPORTS IN METHODOLOGICAL SURVEYS, RESEARCH REPORTS AND
DISSERTATIONS. SOCIOLOGICAL INFORMATION CAN BE OF HEURISTIC VALUE IN
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RESEARCH. HOWEVER, HEURISTIC INFORMATION WILL BE SERVICEABLE
ONLY IF THE LIBRARIAN IS FAMILIAR WITH THE SCIENTIST'S AIMS AND FIELD OF
RESEARCH.
