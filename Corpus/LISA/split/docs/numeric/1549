PROVIDES GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON LIBRARIES AND THEIR USERS, AND
RESEARCH WHICH SEEKS TO SOLVE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS AND HELP LIBRARIANS PROVIDE
BETTER SERVICES. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE MAINLY INTERESTED IN THE LATTER. RECENT
RESEARCH HAS BEGUN TO LOOK AT WHY PEOPLE USE PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE RESULTS
ARE BEING USED TO IMPROVE SERVICES. THE BRITISH LIBRARY SUPPORTS RESEARCH

PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND EXAMINING THE ROLE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN RELATION TO

BRITISH LIBRARY ALSO FINANCES RESEARCH CENTRES, WHICH INITIATE RESEARCH, BUILD
UP COLLECTIONS OF RESOURCE MATERIAL AND ADVISE RESEARCHERS. AN ADVISORY COMM
