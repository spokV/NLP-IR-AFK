THE ZERO GROWTH SYNDROME AND THE LIBRARIES' WORK FOR REFORMS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A PANEL DEBATE ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE 80S, ORGANISED BY
THE DANISH LIBRARY INSPECTORATE AND HELD IN OCT 81. LIBRARIES ARE FACED WITH A
SITUATION IN WHICH THEIR USE, ESPECIALLY THAT INVOLVING REFERENCE SERVICES,
GROWS, WHILE DEMANDS FOR CUTS OR ZERO GROWTH ARE MADE. LIBRARIANS HAVE TO GIVE
UP SOME SERVICES, SUCH AS LENGTHY LITERATURE SEARCHES, IN ORDER TO KEEP A
BALANCE IN THE GENERAL SERVICE LEVEL AND ARE FACED WITH AN INVIDIOUS CHOICE
BETWEEN THE KINDS OF MATERIAL-NEWSPAPERS, REFERENCE BOOKS, JOURNALS-WHICH HAVE
TO BE AXED. THERE IS A NEED FOR AN OVERALL PLANNING BODY WHICH CAN DECIDE
PRIORITIES ON PROFESSIONAL GROUNDS. ARGUES FOR STRENGTHENING OF THE REFERENCE
SECTIONS IN SMALLER LIBRARIES BY APPOINTMENT OF REFERENCE LIBRARIANS AND FOR
THE FREE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY TO ALL PUBLICLY OWNED
LIBRARIES. CENTRALLY PRODUCED REFERENCE AIDS HELP IN THE CHOICE OF PRIORITIES
AND FREE STAFF FOR OTHE R TASKS, BUT MORE ARE NEEDED. A PERIOD OF CUTS SHOULD
BE USED TO PLAN FUTURE EXPANSION.
