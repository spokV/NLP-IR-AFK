DISASTER' PREVENTION, PREPAREDNESS AND ACTION.

AWARENESS STIMULATED BY WELL-PUBLICISED DISASTERS HAS RESULTED IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS PLANS AND IN BETTER TECHNIQUES FOR
COPING RESPONSIBLY IF THE WORST HAPPENS. UNDERSTANDING THE NATURAL HAZARDS OF
AN AREA, ANTICIPATING PROBLEMS AND MAINTAINING BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS TO
WITHSTAND DISASTER MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TOTAL LOSS AND DAMAGE. FIRE
PREVENTION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS FIRE NOT ONLY DESTROYS BOOKS BUT BRINGS
THE POSSIBILITY OF MASSIVE VOLUMES OF WATER. CONSIDERATIONS FOR PREPLANNING
INCLUDE ASSIGNING SPECIFIC TASKS, KNOWING SOURCES OF SUPPLIES, LISTS OF
RELEVANT TELEPHONE NUMBERS, ESTABLISHING PRIORITIES IN THE STOCK, DEVELOPING
PLANS FOR TREATING WATER- AND FIRE-DAMAGED MATERIALS AND INSURANCE. BRIEFLY
LOOKS AT ACTION TO BE TAKEN IF DISASTER STRIKES AND OUTLINES SOME US
INITIATIVES.
