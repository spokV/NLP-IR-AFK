THE MANAGEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION.

A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1979 QUEBEC CORPORATION DES BIBLIOTHECAIRES
PROFESSIONNELS CONFERENCE, CONSIDERING HOW LIBRARIANS SHOULD APPROACH THE
INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY. THE NECESSITY OF PLANNING IS ILLUSTRATED BY
EXAMPLES OF VARIOUS CANADIAN UNIVERSITY PROJECTS, AND THE SOPHISTICATED
MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES OF TODAY COMPARED WITH THE EARLY EXPERIMENTAL PHASE IN
THE 1960S. PLANNING INVOLVES CONSIDERATION OF COSTS, BENEFITS AND OPERATIONAL
SATISFACTION IN THE PRELIMINARY PHASE, WHILE IMPLEMENTATION CHIEFLY INVOLVES
MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN RELATIONS, AND THE ADOPTION OF A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO
CHANGE WHICH TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF ALTERING CURRENT
PRACTICES. LIBRARIANS ATTITUDES TO AUTOMATION VARY, BUT THE ESSENTIAL GOAL IS
IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTING TECHNIQUES, NOT INNOVATION FOR ITS OWN SAKE, WITH THE
EMPHASIS ON ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, EFFICIENT SERVICE PROVISION, AND HARMONIOUS
USER RELATIONS.
