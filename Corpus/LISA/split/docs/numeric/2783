APPLICATION OF AN ENTROPY MEASURE FOR JOURNAL EVALUATION AND ITS COMPARISON TO
OTHER QUANTITATIVE MEASURES.
     
(PHD THESIS-CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY, OHIO). USING A SET OF 856
JOURNALS INDEXED IN 1978 BY 2INDEX MEDICUS1 AND BY THE CITING JOURNAL PACKAGE
OF 2JOURNAL CITATION REPORTS1, A NEW QUANTITATIVE MEASURE HAVING A THEORETICAL
BASIS (ENTROPY MEASURE) WAS TESTED. THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF 4
OTHER MEASURES REPRESENTING AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH. ALL 5 SETS OF RESULTS WERE
COMPARED WITH CORE JOURNAL LISTS AND A PEER REVIEW RANKING OF SOME OF THE
TITLES. THE 5 MEASURES SEEMED TO REPRESENT DIFFERENT JOURNAL PROPERTIES. THE
ENTROPY MEASURE INVOLVED THE BRILLOUIN INFORMATION MEASURE (THE CONTRIBUTION
OF A JOURNAL TO THE COMMUNICATION NETWORK RELATED TO A JOURNAL POPULATION).
THE JOURNAL SELECTION PROCESS WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE USE OF ANY OF THE 5
MEASURES, EVEN THOUGH THEY PRODUCE VARYING RESULTS.
