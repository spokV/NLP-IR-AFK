SHODDY AND PERNICIOUS BOOKS AND YOUTHFUL PURITY' LITERARY AND MORAL
CENSORSHIP, THEN AND NOW.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THOUGH SOME LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERS
BELIEVE CENSORSHIP IS A RECENT PHENOMENON, IT HAS BEEN A PART OF LIBRARIANS'
LIVES FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY. INDEED, MANY LATE-19TH CENTURY LIBRARIANS
REGARDED THEMSELVES PRIMARILY AS CENSORS, DUTY-BOUND TO PROTECT THE YOUNG FROM
SHODDY AND PERNICIOUS BOOKS, ESPECIALLY FICTION. SOME LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERS
TODAY CARRY ON THIS CENSORIAL TRADITION BY CIRCULATING OR TEACHING ONLY WORKS
OF HIGH LITERARY MERIT OR THE PROPER MORAL CONTENT. THOSE CENSORING ON
LITERARY GROUNDS OFTEN PROVIDE ONLY SUBJECTIVE CRITERIA, JUSTIFYING CENSORSHIP
BY THEIR OWN PERSONAL TASTES. THOSE CENSORING ON MORAL GROUNDS OFTEN PROVIDE
NO BETTER CRITERIA, JUSTIFYING CENSORSHIP BY THEIR OWN PERSONAL MORALITY. LIBR
ARIANS AND TEACHERS HAVE NO RIGHT TO IMPOSE PERSONAL LITERARY OR MORAL
STANDARDS ON THE PUBLIC, YOUNG OR OLD. THEY HAVE A DUTY TO PROVIDE MATERIALS
OF ALL SORTS TO ALLOW CLIENTS AND STUDENTS TO SEARCH THROUGH AND SEEK OUT
IDEAS.
