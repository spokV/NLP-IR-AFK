INTERACTION OF LIBRARIES AND PUBLISHERS.
     
LIBRARIES AND PUBLISHERS HAVE EVOLVED TOGETHER. PUBLISHERS RELY ON LIBRARIES
AS A MINIMUM MARKET FOR THEIR SCHOLARLY PRODUCTS. INFLATIONARY PRESSURES HAVE
CAUSED PUBLISHERS TO INCREASE PRICES THAT, IN TURN, STRAIN LIBRARY BUDGETS
THAT HAVE NOT INCREASED AS FAST, AND WHICH, IN TURN, UNDERMINE THE MINIMAL
DEMAND PUBLISHERS CAN COUNT ON, ADDING TO INFLATIONARY PRESSURE. A SIMPLE
MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR THE DYNAMICS OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND
PUBLISHERS IS ANALYSED.
