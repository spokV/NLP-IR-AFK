THE SYSTEM IS THE SOLUTION' AN APPROACH TO INCREASED TECHNICAL SERVICES
PRODUCTIVITY.

IN 1978, ONTARIO'S UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO DISCOVERED A BACKLOG OF BOOKS IN ITS
CATALOGUING DEPARTMENT AFTER A CATALOGUING REVISION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
FULL MARC CODING. A NEW APPROACH TO COPING WITH THE BACKLOG PROVED VERY
SUCCESSFUL. A 5-POINT PROCEDURE WAS FOLLOWED' (1) EVALUATE PRESENT OPERATION
AND VARIOUS TASKS; (2) ANALYSE THESE TASKS TO DETECT NON-PRODUCTIVE AREAS OR
AREAS IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT; (3) DESIGN A SOLUTION; (4) DOCUMENT THE NEW
PROCEDURES; AND (5) IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION. THE PROCEDURES HIGHLIGHTED THE
FACT THAT MORE TIME WAS SPENT IN FINDING CATALOGUE COPY THAN IN ANY OTHER
TASK. WHEN THIS TIME WAS CUT DOWN THROUGH THE USE OF THE MARC DISTRIBUTION
SERVICE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, THE SYSTEM PROVED SUITABLY STREAMLINED TO
ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG IN THE CATALOGUING DEPARTMENT.
