FRENCH MAP LIBRARIES AND NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS.
     
THE SITUATION OF MAP COLLECTIONS IN FRANCE IS NOT WELL KNOWN, AND THEIR PLACE
IN FRENCH DATA SYSTEMS IS LIMITED. HOWEVER SOME ACTIONS IN PROFESSIONAL
TRAINING AND 2 IMPORTANT EXHIBITIONS, DEVOTED TO EARLY AND MODERN MAPS, HAVE
FOR SOME YEARS DRAWN ATTENTION TO MAP COLLECTIONS. DISCUSSES THE
ADMINISTRATION OF MAP COLLECTIONS AND VARIOUS PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS WHICH
ARE CONCERNED WITH MAPS AND RELATED SUBJECTS. ALSO MENTIONS THE WORK OF THE
WORKING GROUP ON MAP LIBRARIES SET UP BY THE COMITE FRANCAIS DE CARTOGRAPHIE
(CFC).
