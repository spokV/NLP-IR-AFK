SHEDDING LIGHT ON TELETEXT.

DISCUSSES THE USE OF TELETEXT IN THE UK AND PRESENTS THE FINDINGS OF A RECENT
SURVEY OF TELETEXT USERS CARRIED OUT BY CIT (COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY) RESEARCH (2TELETEXT AND PRESTEL' USER REACTIONS1). TELETEXT
APPEARS TO BE USED AS AN ADDITIONAL RATHER THAN ALTERNATIVE DATA SOURCE; IS
ACCESSED AN AVERAGE OF 1-4 TIMES DAILY BY EACH USER; AND IS MOST OFTEN USED
FOR NEWS, WEATHER, TRAVEL, AND SPORT. 93% OF USERS ARE SATISFIED, ALTHOUGH 29%
DESCRIBE IT AS INCOMPLETE. WARNS THAT CURRENT USERS ARE HIGHLY INNOVATIVE IN
THEIR APPROACH AND MAY NOT BE TYPICAL OF FUTURE USERS. CONCLUDES THAT A
DEFINITE CONSUMER MARKET EXISTS FOR TELETEXT.
