PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT' THE SOUTH AFRICAN SCENE.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT (PLR). IN SOUTH
AFRICA, AUTHORS ARE NOT REMUNERATED FOR USE OF THEIR WORKS IN LIBRARIES AND,
IN COMPARISON WITH MOST WESTERN COUNTRIES, VERY LITTLE IS BEING DONE BY THE
STATE TO SUPPORT AUTHORS FINANCIALLY AND STIMULATE LOCAL BOOK PRODUCTION AND
LITERATURE. RELATIVELY FEW PUBLICATIONS ON PLR HAVE APPEARED AND THE AUTHORS'
CAMPAIGN FOR A PLR SYSTEM HAS NOT YET GAINED MOMENTUM.
