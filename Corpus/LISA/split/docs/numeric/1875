SOME SIGNIFICANT RESULTS OF CURRENT CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH IN INDIA.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON CURRENT TRENDS IN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH. BASED
ON THE PAPER 'A GENERAL THEORY OF SIL, POPSI AND CLASSAURUS', SUBMITTED FOR
DISCUSSION AT THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH FORUM, MINNEAPOLIS,
OCT 79. A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF 3 INDIAN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS. A
GENERAL THEORY OF SUBJECT INDEXING LANGUAGE (SIL) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH
LOGICAL ABSTRACTION OF THE STRUCTURES OF OUTSTANDING SILS. THE LANGUAGE OF
POSTULATE-BASED PERMUTED SUBJECT INDEXING (POPSI) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH
THE INTERPRETATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF SILS FORMING PART OF THE GENERAL
THEORY. THE CLASSAURUS HAS ALSO BEEN FORMULATED; THIS IS A FACETED SYSTEMATIC
SCHEME OF HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFICATION HAVING ALL THE NECESSARY ATTRIBUTES OF A
CONVENTIONAL THESAURUS, EXCLUDING THE NUMERATION OF OTHER RELATED TERMS AND IS
ESPECIALLY MEANT TO FACILITATE THE USE OF POPSI.
