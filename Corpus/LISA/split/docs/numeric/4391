CLUSTERING IN FREE-TEXT DATA BASES.
     
DEFINES CLUSTERS AS SETS OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS RELATED BY SIMILAR CHEMICAL
STRUCTURE AND ACTIVITY AND APPLIES HEURISTIC CLUSTERING METHODS FOR TEXT DATA
TO A DATA BASE DESCRIBING CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS WITH MEDICAL USES. CONCLUDES THAT
CONSIDERATION OF MULTIPLE MEDICAL USE CLUSTERING ASSURES COMPREHENSIVENESS AND
SUPPLEMENTS ANY WEAKNESS OF PURELY HEURISTIC SEARCHING. THE EXISTENCE OF THE
AFOREMENTIONED CHEMICAL SIMILARITIES PERMITS THE EXPLORATION OF NEW OR
PREVIOUSLY UNREPORTED USES OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS BY COMPUTER MANIPULATION OF
DATA.
