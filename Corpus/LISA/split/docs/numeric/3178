ON THE QUESTION OF CHARGING FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES.
     
A STATEMENT FROM THE DEUTSCHER BIBLIOTHEKSVERBAND (GERMAN LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION.) THE CHARGES UNDER DISCUSSION ARE FOR THE LOAN OF BOOKS,
PERIODICALS AND OTHER MEDIA, AND DO NOT REFER TO SPECIAL SERVICES SUCH AS
PHOTOCOPYING. THE ASSOCIATION IS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO CHARGES BEING MADE FOR
BASIC SERVICES WHICH IT REGARDS AS A RETROGRADE STEP THAT COULD ONLY HARM THE
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE AND DETRACT FROM ITS EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL VALUE IN
THE COMMUNITY. THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS FAR OUTWEIGH ANY POSSIBLE FINANCIAL
GAIN.
