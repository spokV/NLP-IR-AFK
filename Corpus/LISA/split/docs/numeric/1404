PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF COMPOUND WORDS IN THESAURI, WITH SPECIAL
REFERENCE TO BS 5723' 1979.

ALTHOUGH MANY LARGE SYSTEMS HAVE BY-PASSED THE PROBLEM BY USING NATURAL
LANGUAGE, COMPOUND WORDS REMAIN A DIFFICULTY IN THESAURUS CONSTRUCTION. FORMER
ATTEMTS TO DEVISE RULES WHICH ATTEMPT TO APPROACH THE PROBLEM VIA SYNTAX WERE
NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFACTORY. PROPOSES THAT THE MAJOR CRITERIA FOR HANDLING
COMPOUND WORDS SHOULD REST UPON THEIR ORTHOGRAPHY, LEXICOGRAPHY AND SEMANTICS,
WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE POSSIBLE OCCURRENCE OF HOMOGRAPHS (WORDS OF A
COMMON FORM BUT DIFFERENT MEANINGS). SUGGESTIONS CONTAINED IN BRITISH STANDARD
5723-2GUIDELINES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF MONOLINGUAL
THESAURI1-ARE ASSESSED IN RELATION TO THESE CRITERIA. THE STANDARD IS
CRITICISED FOR ITS INSUFFICIENT ATTENTION TO MECHANISED SYSTEMS' REQUIREMENTS
AND PARTIAL FAILURE IN NOT RECORDING THE DIVERGENT NEEDS OF PRE- AND
POST-COORDINATE SYSTEMS.
