THE CAMPAIGN FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NEW SOUTH WALES, 1929-1950.

THE PERIOD 1890-1930 WITNESSED A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN
NEW SOUTH WALES BUT BY 1930 SEVERAL PROMINENT CITIZENS BEGAN TO SEE THEM AS
USEFUL ADJUNCTS TO THE CAMPAIGN TO IMPROVE AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION. THE CARNEGIE
CORPORATION OF NEW YORK PROVIDED FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND THE FREE LIBRARY
MOVEMENT WAS SET UP IN SYDNEY. MASS DEMAND FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS NOT REALLY
A MOTIVE FORCE IN THE REVIVAL. WORLD WAR 2 EMPHASISED THE NEED TO PRESERVE
DEMOCRACY THROUGH EDUCATION AND ALSO ESTABLISHED THE IDEA THAT CULTURE WAS NOT
THE PRESERVE OF THE INTELLECTUAL ELITE ALONE. POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION BROUGHT
WITH IT A TIDE OF LARGELY BRITISH IMMIGRANTS WHO HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS OF
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES. THE IMPETUS PROVIDED BY THE WAR WAS SHORT LIVED,
HOWEVER, AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE FORCED TO STAND ALONE. THIS TIME THEY WERE
ABLE TO SURVIVE THROUGH THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE LIBRARIANS.
