THE VATICAN LIBRARY.
     
DESCRIBES THE VATICAN LIBRARY. DESPITE NUMEROUS PLUNDERS AND DISPERSALS OF THE
COLLECTIONS THE LIBRARY HAS GROWN UNDER THE CARE OF MANY LIBRARY CARDINALS AND
POPES. THUS ON THE DEATH OF POPE NICHOLAS V IN 1455 IT CONTAINED EUROPE'S
LARGEST MANUSCRIPT COLLECTION. THE OFFICIAL FOUNDATION WAS LAID WITH SIXTUS
IV'S BULL IN 1475, THE COLLECTION WAS ORGANISED IN 4 PARTS, AND THE 1ST
CATALOGUE APPEARED IN 1485. A LIBERAL LENDING POLICY WAS STOPPED FOR ALL TIME
BY SIXTUS V, WHO ALSO HAD THE PRESENT BUILDING ERECTED IN 1588. EXPANSION
FORCED THE LIBRARY TO OCCUPY ROOMS OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL SISTINE SALOON. THE
20TH CENTURY HAS SEEN MODERNISATION OF THE BUILDING AND OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND
LIBRARY TECHNIQUES. THE LIBRARY CONTAINS AMONG MANY PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPTS THE
COLLECTION BELONGING TO QUEEN CHRISTINA OF SWEDEN. CATALOGUING OF MANUSCRIPTS,
INCUNABULA AND PRINTED BOOKS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE 15TH CENTURY.
