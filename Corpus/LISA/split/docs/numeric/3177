AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND LIBRARIANSHIP HAD MUCH IN COMMON IN THE 1930S,
STEMMING FROM A COMMON UK TRADITION, YET EACH COUNTRY MADE QUITE A DIFFERENT
RESPONSE TO THE CARNEGIE CORPORATION OF NEW YORK AID PROGRAMME TO STIMULATE

DEVELOPMENTS TOOK PLACE IN THE 1930S-40S; IN AUSTRALIA, SOME EQUIVALENT
DEVELOPMENTS WERE NOT ACCOMPLISHED UNTIL THE 1960S. EXAMINES THE REASONS FOR
THIS.
