WHEN THE LIBRARY SCHOOL WANTS TO ALTER ITS ROAD-MAP.
     
REACTIONS OF LIBRARIANS TO RECENT PROPOSALS (TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE 1976-77
REPORTS ON POSSIBLE ELEVATION TO UNIVERSITY STATUS) FOR A NEW CURRICULUM IN
THE NORWEGIAN STATE LIBRARY SCHOOL. POINTS COVERED INCLUDE THE PROPOSED 2-YEAR
COMMON COURSE, WITH SPECIALISATION IN THE 3RD YEAR (GENERALLY APPROVED);
METHODS SUBJECTS (BIBLIOGRAPHY IS CONSIDERED NECESSARY, BUT SOME CONSIDER
COMPUTER STUDIES NOWADAYS EQUALLY ESSENTIAL); LITERATURE AND SOCIETY (THOUGHT
TO MERIT MORE ATTENTION, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, POPULAR LITERATURE,
AND SERVICES TO HANDICAPPED AND IMMIGRANTS); INFORMATION SCIENCE (SHOULD BE
INCLUDED IN 2 OR EVEN 3 YEARS); ADMINISTRATION (CONSIDERED ABSOLUTELY
ESSENTIAL); PRACTICAL TRAINING (SHOULD PROBABLY BE EXTENDED); EVALUATION OF
STUDENTS' WORK (GENERAL OPINION FAVOURS THE RETENTION OF MARKING TOGETHER WITH
CONTINUOUS EVALUATION); LECTURING STAFF (LIBRARY EXPERIENCE IS PREFERRED TO
ACADEMIC SPECIALISATION); INTAKE OF STUD ENTS (AS FAR AS POSSIBLE SHOULD COVER
THE WHOLE COUNTRY). BETTER LIAISON ON EDUCATION BETWEEN SCHOOL AND LIBRARY
PROFESSION IS FELT DESIRABLE, BUT THERE SEEMS NO MAJOR DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE CURRICULUM COMMITTEE AND LIBRARIANS IN THE FIELD.
