COOLOCK PUBLIC LIBRARY IN DUBLIN CITY FOR USER EDUCATION. DISCUSSES A NUMBER
OF DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN THE MAKING OF THE FILM, AND NOTES SOME OF THE
LESSONS LEARNT BY STAFF DURING ITS PRODUCTION. INDICATES SOME IMPROVEMENTS
WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE FILM IF IT HAD BEEN PRODUCED BY PROFESSIONAL
FILM MAKERS AND ON MORE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT. NEVERTHELESS, STRESSES THE
