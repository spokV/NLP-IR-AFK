POPIN: AN INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION NETWORK FOR THE POPULATION FIELD.

(NOTE. ORIGINAL PRESENTATION IN FRENCH; ENGLISH VERSION PUBLISHED AT AUTHOR'S
REQUEST.) THE INTERNATIONAL POPULATION INFORMATION NETWORK (POPIN) IS BEING
ESTABLISHED IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASING RECOGNITION OF THE VALUE OF SUCH
INFORMATION, THE DESIRE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO BUILD THEIR OWN INFORMATION
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE NEED TO TIE TOGETHER ISOLATED ACTIVITIES TO MAXIMISE
BENEFITS. IT IS DEVELOPING AS A REGIONAL AND NATIONAL OPERATION WITH
ACTIVITIES INTEGRATED THROUGH A CENTRAL COORDINATING UNIT. THE 1ST MEETING OF
THE POPIN ADVISORY GROUP (SCHEDULED FOR EARLY 1980) WAS TO DISCUSS WAYS OF
IMPROVING INTERCONNECTIONS AMONG EXISTING POPULATION INFORMATION SYSTEMS;
RESOLVE PROBLEMS OF STANDARDISATION, UNIFORMITY, AND COORDINATION; AND REACH A
CONSENSUS ON THE NETWORK'S OPERATION.
