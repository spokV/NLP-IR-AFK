CONSIDERING THE DISABLED IN SCHOOL LIBRARIES' ATTITUDES AND LIBRARY DESIGN.
     
WITH THE INTRODUCTION AND INCREASING PREVALENCE OF MAINSTREAMING IN SCHOOLS,
IT IS INEVITABLE THAT SOME STUDENTS WILL HAVE TO COPE WITH SOME DEGREE OF
DISABILITY. DISABILITIES VARY TREMENDOUSLY, BOTH IN TYPE AND DEGREE TO WHICH
NORMAL FUNCTIONING IS IMPAIRED. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ALL STUDENTS BE GIVEN THE
SAME CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT REGARDLESS OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES.
LIBRARIANS CAN CONTRIBUTE MOST BY UNDERSTANDING THE SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES AND
NEEDS OF THE CHILD. ABILITIES RATHER THAN DISABILITIES NEED TO BE EMPHASISED.
BESIDES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL BARRIERS, THE PROBLEM OF SIMPLE PHYSICAL
ACCESS MUST BE CONSIDERED. DESIGN FEATURES THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED INCLUDE
ACCESS TO THE BUILDING, ACCESS WITHIN THE LIBRARY AND ACCESS TO ALL LIBRARY
SERVICES.
