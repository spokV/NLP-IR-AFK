DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ON ENERGY CONSERVATION TO SMALL ENERGY USERS.
     
AN INSTITUTIONAL NETWORK THAT PROVIDES HOMEOWNERS, SMALL BUSINESSES, AND OTHER
SMALL-SCALE ENERGY USERS WITH ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON ENERGY CONSERVATION
TECHNIQUES AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES WAS CREATED WHEN THE NATIONAL
ENERGY EXTENSION SERVICE (EES) WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1978. TO HELP EES PROVIDE
PRACTICAL REFERENCE MATERIALS AND RESPONSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO STATE
ENERGY EXTENSION SERVICE OFFICES, THE CENTER FOR ENERGY POLICY AND RESEARCH
(CEPR) OF THE NEW YORK INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY WAS RETAINED BY THE US
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO SET UP AND OPERATE A NATIONAL INFORMATION
CLEARINGHOUSE FOR THE ENERGY EXTENSION SERVICE. THROUGH THIS CLEARINGHOUSE
CEPR PRODUCES AND DELIVERS TO ALL STATES AND US TERRITORIES MONTHLY ENERGY
INFORMATION PACKAGES THAT CONTAIN COMPLETE COPIES OR SUMMARIES OF PRACTICAL
REFERENCE MATERIALS ON ENERGY CONSERVATION AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES, AS
WELL AS RETRIEVAL AIDS FOR ALL PACKAGE ENCLOSURES.
