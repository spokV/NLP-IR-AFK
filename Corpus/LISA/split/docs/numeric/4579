SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND BASIC EDUCATION IN FIRST AND SECOND GRADE SCHOOLS IN THE
STATE OF SAO PAULO, BRAZIL.
     
DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS AS
PRESCRIBED BY BRAZILIAN STATE LEGISLATION, AND SUGGESTS CLOSER INTEGRATION OF
SCHOOL AND LIBRARY TASKS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE STRUCTURE OF SCHOOL
ORGANISATION, WHICH ASSIGNS THE LIBRARY TO THE CATEGORY OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT
FOR TEACHING PROGRAMMES AND DESIGNATES IT AN EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITY.
CRITICISES THIS AS AN INADEQUATE CONCEPTION OF THE LIBRARY'S ROLE, AND ARGUES
FOR ACTIVE COLLABORATION IN THE TEACHING PROCESS, AS A BACK-UP MULTI-MEDIA
RESOURCE CENTRE. EXAMINES THE OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE LIBRARY, AND SHOWS HOW
INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED FOR THE FULFILMENT OF EVEN ITS NOMINAL
TASKS. IN CONCLUSION A RESTRUCTURING OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS PROPOSED,
PERMITTING TOTAL INTEGRATION OF LIBRARY AND TEACHING PROGRAMMES AT ALL LEVELS.
