THIS ONE-SIDED PRAXIS-WORSHIP.
     
A NORWEGIAN STATE LIBRARY SCHOOL STUDENT REBUTS 3 CLAIMS MADE BY PREVIOUS
WRITERS (SPECIAL SECTION ON LIBRARY EDUCATION IN NORWAY, 2IBID1 46 (8) 1979;
2SEE1 81/60)' (1) THAT LECTURERS HAVE TOO LITTLE PRACTICAL LIBRARY EXPERIENCE
(&H HAVE EXTENSIVE LIBRARY EXPERIENCE, WHILE THE OTHERS MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH
CURRENT LIBRARY PRACTICE); (2) THAT THE COURSE CONTAINS TOO LITTLE PRACTICAL
TRAINING (THE NEW 3-YEAR THEORETICAL CURRICULUM IS A STEP FORWARD. INTERNAL
AND EXTERNAL PRACTICAL WORK, THOUGH STILL NECESSARY, ARE OF LIMITED VALUE IN A
CONSTANTLY DEVELOPING NATIONAL LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE SCHOOL'S PRIMARY TASK IS TO
EDUCATE INDEPENDENT, CRITICAL LIBRARIANS WHO CAN EVALUATE THEIR ROLE IN A
SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE AND BE OPEN TO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE); AND (3) THAT
INSTRUCTION IS TOO THEORETICAL (ON THE CONTRARY, THERE IS A TENDENCY TO
OVER-VALUE DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK, VIEWING LIBRARIANSHIP AS A SERVICE
INDUSTRY RATHER THAN A SCHOLARLY DISCIPLINE). A MORE LIBRARY /SOCIOLOGICAL-
AND PROJECT-ORIENTED CURRICULUM IS NEEDED, CALLING FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF
COMMITMENT FROM BOTH STUDENTS AND LECTURERS.
