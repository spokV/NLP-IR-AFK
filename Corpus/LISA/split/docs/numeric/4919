NORMALIZATION OF TITLES AND THEIR RETRIEVAL.
     
THE TITLE EXPRESSED BY A NOUN PHRASE OR CLAUSE IS CONVERTED TO A
FUNCTION-EXPRESSION BY PARSING. FOR RETRIEVAL WITH A REASONABLE RECALL RATE AS
WELL AS A HIGH PRECISION RATE, THE FUNCTION-EXPRESSION IS TRANSFORMED TO A
PREDICATE-GOVERNOR FORM AND THEN NORMALISED TO A STANDARD FORM. VARIOUS ITEMS
ARE TAKEN FROM THIS AND RECORDED IN A HIERARCHICAL, TREE-LIKE INVERTED FILE.
TO KEEP RECALL AT A REASONABLE RATE, SEVERAL RETRIEVAL STAGES ARE IMPLEMENTED
BASED ON THE KEY-TERM AND CASE-LABEL MATCHING. RETRIEVAL IS CONTROLLED BY THE
PRECISENESS OF THE SPECIFICATION OF CASE-LABELS FOR EACH KEY-TERM.
