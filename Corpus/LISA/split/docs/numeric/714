INFORMATION AND REFERRAL FOR HANDICAPPED INDIVIDUALS.

CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON INFORMATION SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED.
INFORMATION IS NO PANACEA AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR SERVICES, BUT IT CAN
CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS OVERCOMING MANY OF THE BARRIERS AROUND THE HANDICAPPED.
THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF INFORMATION AND REFERRAL ACTIVITY FOR THE HANDICAPPED
IN THE USA, BUT IT IS UNEVENLY DISTRIBUTED AND THE HANDICAPPED ARE NOT ALWAYS
AWARE OF IT. LIBRARIES CAN BE A GREAT SOURCE OF BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT
HANDICAPPING CONDITIONS, COPING TECHNIQUES, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SOURCES,
AND RELEVANT LOCAL AND NATIONAL ORGANISATIONS. INCLUDES A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF US
PUBLICATIONS CONTAINING INFORMATION ON INFORMATION AND REFERRAL SERVICES FOR
THE HANDICAPPED.
