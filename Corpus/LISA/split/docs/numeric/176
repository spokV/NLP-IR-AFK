REVENUE SHARING AND STATE FUNDING IN INDIANA: PROSPECTS IMPROVE FOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES.

IN THE EARLY 70S THE FISCAL OUTLOOK FOR INDIANA'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS
ABYSMALLY DEPRESSING, WITH MOST LIBRARIES HAVING NO OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE
IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS. HOWEVER, AS THE DECADE
PROGRESSED, SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE BILLS FAVOURABLE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE
ENACTED. THESE FOLLOWED THE REVENUE SHARING ACT OF 1972, WHICH PERMITTED
GOVERNMENT UNITS TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEIR
OWN REVENUES WERE EXPENDED. IN 1978, REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS INCREASED
DRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE STATE LEGISLATORS' SECOND ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE
PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH ACCESS TO REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS, WITH THE PASSAGE OF
SENATE-ENROLLED ACT NO. 208. THE OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK FOR THE 80S IS TEMPERED
ONLY BY THE CONCERN OF LIBRARIANS ABOUT STATE LEGISLATORS' COMMITMENT TO
CONTINUE STATE FUNDING OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
