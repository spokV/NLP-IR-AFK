INFORMATION AND ORGANIZATION POLICIES IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION.
     
ANALYSES THE PUBLIC INFORMATION POLICIES OF THE NETHERLANDS CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
AND THE CITY OF AMSTERDAM USING THE 'INFORMATION PARADIGM' FOR THE ANALYSIS OF
ORGANISATIONS AND GALBRAITH'S 'INFORMATION MODEL' FOR THE DESIGN OF
ORGANISATIONS. THE COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF THESE 2 THEORIES IS THE HYPOTHESIS
THAT THERE IS A DIRECT RELATION BETWEEN INFORMATION STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION
STRUCTURE. FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW, SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 2
POLICIES ARE INDICATED, TOGETHER WITH THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR INFORMATIONAL
RELATIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS ARE
DRAWN.
