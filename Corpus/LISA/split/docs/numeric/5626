REPORT ON THE FIRST OPEN MEETING OF THE WORKING GROUP ON LIBRARY SERVICE TO
ETHNIC AND LINGUISTIC MINORITIES.

LIBRARY SERVICES TO ETHNIC AND LINGUISTIC MINORITIES POSE A MAJOR PROBLEM IN
MANY COUNTRIES BECAUSE OF SCARCITY OF APPROPRIATE MATERIAL. INTERESTED EXPERTS
MET FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH THE IFLA WORKING GROUP ON THE SUBJECT DURING THE
IFLA COUNCIL AND GENERAL CONFERENCE IN LEIPZIG (AUG 81) TO DISCUSS THE BEST
WAY OF PROVIDING THESE SERVICES.
