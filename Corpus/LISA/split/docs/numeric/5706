ALL LIBRARY SERVICE SHOULD BE FREE OF CHARGE.

IN THE BILL FOR A NEW DANISH LIBRARY ACT, WHICH WILL SHORTLY BE TABLED IN THE
FOLKETING, THE CLAUSE REGARDING A FREE LIBRARY SERVICE WILL, IT SEEMS, BE
RETAINED. QUESTIONS WHETHER THE PARTIES WHO BELIEVE THAT A CHARGE SHOULD BE
LEVIED FOR LIBRARY USE WILL MANAGE TO INFLUENCE THE FINAL FORM OF THE ACT. IF
THE PRINCIPLE OF A FREE SERVICE GOES BY THE BOARD, EVERY IDEA OF AN EQUAL
SERVICE TO ALL WILL GO BY THE BOARD WITH IT, WITH THE CONSEQUENT BAD EFFECT ON
PUBLISHING HOUSES, BOOKSHOPS AND AUTHORS.
