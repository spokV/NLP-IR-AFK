ACQUISITIONS BUDGET CONTROL IN A CAE LIBRARY.
     
OUTLINES THE HISTORY OF ACQUISITIONS BUDGET CONTROL AT THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN
INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY (KNOWN AS THE T.L. ROBERTSON LIBRARY). DURING
THE 1970S, THE ACQUISITIONS BUDGET WAS ADEQUATE; THIS IS NOW QUESTIONABLE.
DISCUSSES THE BUDGET CONTROL OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE LIBRARY AND SUGGESTS A
FLEXIBLE APPROACH TO SUBJECT BUDGETS, A PORTION OF THE MONOGRAPH BUDGET BEING
EARMARKED FOR SPECIAL NEEDS AND THE REMAINING LARGER SHARE BEING APPORTIONED
TO THE SUBJECT AREAS.
