TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA' A NEW CHALLENGE FOR THE DESIGNER.

TELETEXT AND VIEWDATA DISPLAYS PRESENT A STRONG CHALLENGE TO THE INFORMATION
DESIGNER. THE MONOSPACED DOT MATRIX CHARACTERS ARE RELATIVELY CRUDE IN THEIR
DESIGN, AND THEIR POSITIONING IS DETERMINED BY A FIXED GRID. THE GRAPHICS
FACILITY IS ALSO SOMEWHAT CRUDE. THE SCOPE FOR TYPOGRAPHIC AND SPATIAL CODING
OF INFORMATION IS THEREFORE VERY LIMITED. THERE IS, HOWEVER, THE POSSIBILITY
OF USING COLOUR AS A WAY OF CODING INFORMATION. 7 COLOURS, INCLUDING WHITE,
ARE AVAILABLE, BUT THEY ARE NOT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AND THIS HAS IMPORTANT
IMPLICATIONS FOR LEGIBILITY. BEARING IN MIND THE CONSTRAINTS AND FREEDOM
OFFERED BY THIS KIND OF DISPLAY, WAYS OF PRESENTING TEXT, TABLES, INDEXES AND
GRAPHICS OF VARIOUS KINDS ARE DISCUSSED.
