NEW ERA OF THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN BRATISLAVA.
     
THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP IN BRATISLAVA WAS FOUNDED IN 1953, SIMULTANEOUSLY
WITH SIMILAR SCHOOLS IN PRAGUE AND BRNO. AFTER OVERCOMING CONSIDERABLE
DIFFICULTIES OF VARIOUS KINDS IN THE 1ST 10 YEARS OF ITS HISTORY, THE SCHOOL
HAS CONCENTRATED IN EDUCATING AND TRAINING PROSPECTIVE NON-GRADUATE LIBRARIANS
AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS. SO FAR ABOUT 3,000 STUDENTS HAVE COMPLETED THEIR
FULL-TIME OR PART-TIME COURSES. ALMOST 90% OF THEM WORK IN LIBRARIES AND IN
CENTRES OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION. COMMENCING IN THE
ACADEMIC YEAR 1984-85, NEW SYLLABUSES WILL COME INTO FORCE. THE COURSES
OFFERED WILL BE FULL-TIME ONLY. AFTER 2 YEARS WITH A COMMON CURRICULUM,
STUDENTS WILL TAKE UP EITHER LIBRARIANSHIP OR INFORMATION SCIENCE FOR THE
REMAINING 2 YEARS, WHEN FINAL EXAMINATIONS OF A THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL
NATURE WILL BE HELD. THE NEW PROJECT, WORKED OUT UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE
RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND  TRAINING IN PRAGUE, WILL
BECOME A FURTHER STEP TOWARDS PROVIDING LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES WITH
CAPABLE STAFF.
