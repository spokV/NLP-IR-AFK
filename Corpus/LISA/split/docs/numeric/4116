NEW LIFE IN THE OLD VARDE.
     
GIVES A PORTRAIT OF VARDE PUBLIC LIBRARY, DUE TO TAKE POSSESSION OF A NEW MAIN
LIBRARY IN THE CENTRAL TOWN SQUARE. VARDE HAS BEEN IN LIBRARY UNION WITH 2
OTHER LOCAL AUTHORITIES SINCE 1973, SERVING A TOTAL OF 28,000 INHABITANTS WITH
1 MOBILE AND 10 BRANCH LIBRARIES. THE NEW LIBRARY WILL HAVE 1500 SQ.M. WITH
ROOM FOR EXPANSION, MAKING A MUSIC LIBRARY POSSIBLE EVENTUALLY. INTERVIEWS THE
MAYOR AND CHAIRMAN OF THE UNION LIBRARY, WHO IS PREPARED TO ALLOCATE MORE
MONEY TO THE SERVICE IF DEMAND INCREASES. THE MOBILE LIBRARY HAS BEEN VERY
SUCCESSFUL IN AREAS TOO SPARSELY POPULATED TO SUSTAIN BRANCHES. PARTY POLITICS
IS FORTUNATELY ABSENT AMONG POLITICIANS DEALING WITH LIBRARIES. THEY MUST,
HOWEVER, HAVE THE FINAL RESPONSIBILITY IN BOOK SELECTION, WHILE INTERFERING AS
LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. INTERVIEWS THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN. SINCE THE UNION, SPACE
PROBLEMS HAVE MOUNTED, AND WITH THE NEW LIBRARY, LOANS ARE EXPECTED TO
INCREASE WITHOUT EXTRA ALLOCATION FOR STAFF. WOULD LIKE TO SE E ANOTHER MOBILE
LIBRARY REPLACE SOME OF THE BRANCHES WHICH HAVE FEW LOANS. THE MOBILE LIBRARY
HAS BROUGHT NEW READERS TO THE MAIN LIBRARY. HOWEVER, THE USE OF 1 OF THE
BRANCHES VISITED WAS SUCH THAT A MOBILE LIBRARY COULD NOT REPLACE IT.
