SOURCES FOR THE HISTORY OF CLIMATE.
     
WORK PRESENTED IN 1979 AT A COURSE ON ARCHIVES IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTREAL
HISTORY DEPARTMENT. THE 1ST SECTION DETAILS THE POSSIBLE DATA SOURCES'
METEOROLOGICAL READINGS; TREE DATING; HARVEST RECORDS; EMPIRICAL QUALITATIVE
CLIMATE OBSERVATIONS; AND GLACIER STUDIES. THE 2ND SECTION DISCUSSES THE
DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN GATHERING ADEQUATE SCIENTIFIC MATERIALS IN EACH CASE,
AND CONCLUDES BY EMPHASISING THAT THE HISTORY OF CLIMATE IS NECESSARILY AN
INTER-DISCIPLINARY AND COMPARATIVE FIELD WHERE THE ROLE OF THE ARCHIVIST IS
FUNDAMENTAL.
