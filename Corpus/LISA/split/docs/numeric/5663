U.S. GOVERNMENT PRODUCED AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS.

US GOVERNMENT PRODUCED AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS OFFER A VALUABLE INFORMATION
RESOURCE WHICH IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED BY LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY USERS. THE
LIBRARIAN WHO IS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THEIR AVAILABILITY WILL BE ABLE TO BRING
THESE AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS TO THE ATTENTION OF LIBRARY PATRONS TO WHOM THEY
COULD BE USEFUL. KNOWLEDGE OF THE INDEXES AND LISTS WHICH HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY
COMPILED FOR THESE RESOURCES WILL MAKE THEM AS ACCESSIBLE AS THE MORE FAMILIAR
PRINT GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS.
