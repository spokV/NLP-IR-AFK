FOR GREATER EFFICIENCY OF REGIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES.
     
COMPARED WITH 1939, THERE ARE 4 TIMES AS MANY LIBRARIES IN BULGARIA CATERING
FOR 32 TIMES AS MANY READERS. BOOK COLLECTIONS-ALMOST 83 MILLION VOLUMES AT
PRESENT-HAVE INCREASED 34 TIMES. BULGARIA COMES 5TH IN THE WORLD AS TO THE
NUMBER OF BOOKS PER HEAD OF POPULATION. IN SPITE OF THESE ENCOURAGING
STATISTICS, THE STATE CONTROL COMMITTEE MADE AN INVESTIGATION RECENTLY INTO
THE STRUCTURE, ORGANISATION AND EFFICIENCY OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN 7 REGIONS.
THE AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC, SCHOOL AND TRADE UNION LIBRARIES VARIED GREATLY.
INHABITANTS ON SOME OF THE NEW HOUSING ESTATES HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED UP TO NOW OF
ANY KIND OF LIBRARY SERVICES. THERE WERE CASES OF HAPHAZARD OPENING AND/OR
CLOSING OF LIBRARIES. THERE IS STILL A LACK OF INFORMATION AND REFERENCE
SERVICES, SHORTAGES IN CONSISTENT CATALOGUING AND PROPER UPKEEP OF RARITIES,
RECOVERY OF OVERDUE BOOKS, AS WELL AS INADEQUATE AUDIO-VISUAL AND REPROGRAPHIC
EQUIPMENT. BETTER PLANNING FOR ACQUISITI ONS, AND ALSO MORE CONSIDERATE
DISCARDING OF OBSOLETE ITEMS ARE MOST DESIRABLE. THE COMMITTEE'S FINDINGS WILL
BE PRESENTED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER RELEVANT BODIES WHOSE MEMBERS HAVE
TO TAKE A MUCH MORE ACTIVE INTEREST IN LIBRARIES IN THEIR REGIONS, IN
PARTICULAR IN RURAL AREAS.
