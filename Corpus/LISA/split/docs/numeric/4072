TEACHING LIBRARY SCIENCE. THE UNIVERSITY OF COLOGNE PROGRAMME.
     
TRANSLATION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1980 SEMINAR IN WARSAW BY THE PROFESSOR
OF LIBRARY SCIENCE AT COLOGNE, THE 1ST GERMAN UNIVERSITY TO INCORPORATE A
SPECIFIC PROGRAMME OF STUDY FOR THE SUBJECT INTO ITS CURRICULA. FOR THE
PURPOSE OF INSTRUCTION, THE FIELD OF LIBRARY SCIENCE IS DIVIDED INTO 5
COMPONENTS' LIBRARY THEORY, GENERAL LIBRARIANSHIP, LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY, LIBRARY
HISTORY, AND FORMS OF PUBLICATION AND MATERIALS USED FOR PUBLISHING. THE
CONTENT AND STRUCTURAL SUBDIVISIONS OF THESE AREAS ARE DELINEATED, AND DETAILS
GIVEN OF THE VARIOUS DEGREES AND ELECTIVE PROGRAMMES OFFERED, TOGETHER WITH
THE CORRESPONDING UNIVERSITY REGULATIONS. THE PROGRAMME IS SUGGESTED AS A
MODEL FOR LIBRARY SCIENCE TEACHING IN GERMANY AND OTHER COUNTRIES. FOR
COMPARISON THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS COMPRISING THE BASIC LIBRARY SCIENCE
PROGRAMME AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LOS ANGELES ARE APPENDED.
