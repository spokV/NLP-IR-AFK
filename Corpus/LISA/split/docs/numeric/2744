A RELEVANT LIBRARY SERVICE.
     
LIBRARIES COLLECT, STORE AND DISSEMINATE RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION TO
NATIONAL POPULATIONS. THE TERM 'RELEVANT INFORMATION' IS DISCUSSED IN RELATION
TO THE KENYAN POPULATION. APPROXIMATELY 95% OF THE KENYAN POPULATION IS MADE
UP OF WORKERS AND PEASANTS AND A RELEVANT LIBRARY SERVICE SHOULD BE AWARE OF
THE PROBLEMS THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO FACE. THE CONTENT OF THE INFORMATION
COMMUNICATED, THE WAY IN WHICH IT IS COMMUNICATED AND THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH IT
IS COMMUNICATED ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS WHICH NEED TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE
LIBRARY SERVICE IF IT IS TO SUPPLY INFORMATION TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT
MOST. THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS CITED AS A COUNTRY WHERE SOME SUCCESS
HAS BEEN MADE IN OVERCOMING THESE PROBLEMS. MUCH VALUABLE INFORMATION HAS
ACCUMULATED OVER THE YEARS AMONG THE POPULATION AND COULD BE USEFULLY APPLIED
IF IT WAS SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDED TO THOSE WHO NEED IT.
