IDENTIFIES THE DEVELOPMENT STAGES OF INFORMATION ACTIVITY AS ISSUE,
NOTIFICATION, SERVICE, AND PROVISION OF INFORMATION. EMPHASISES THE NECESSITY

PROVISION AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND ACTIVE WAY OF INFORMING USERS. SUCH A
CHANGE WILL INCREASE THE SCIENTIFIC LEVEL OF THE USER'S RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT WORK AND ACTIVATE THE USE OF THE INFORMATION RESOURCE. STRESSES
THAT INFORMATION ORGANS OF ALL PARTS OF THE STATE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION SYSTEM MUST CARRY OUT INFORMATION PROVISION ONLY.
