A PROPOSAL FOR A NETWORK COMPUTER FOR ONLINE ASSISTANCE.
     
RECENT RESEARCH WORK ON BOTH MICROCOMPUTERS AND MAINFRAME MACHINES HAS SHOWN
THE POTENTIAL FOR PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO THE USER OUTSIDE THE HOST COMPUTER.
THE US MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEMS HAVE CONCENTRATED ON LARGE SCALE SYSTEMS WITH
EXTENSIVE TUTORIAL FACILITIES, SUCH AS THE 01 SAM SYSTEM OFFERED BY THE
FRANKLIN INSTITUTE, OR FORMAT TRANSFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR MOVING DATA FROM ONE
SYSTEM TO ANOTHER AS PROVIDED BY THE CAST SYSTEM MARKETED BY THE COMPUTER
CORPORATION OF AMERICA. THE UK SYSTEM, USERKIT, IS A CHEAPER TERMINAL
ATTACHMENT WHICH SIMPLIFIES LOGON BY PERMANENTLY STORED MESSAGES, REDUCES
SEARCH COSTS BY PRE-FORMULATION OF SEARCH STATEMENTS AND PROVIDES OUTPUT
SELECTION AND RE-TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.
