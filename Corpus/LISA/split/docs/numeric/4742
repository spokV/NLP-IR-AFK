THE RECORDING OF INFORMATION.
     
IN ORDER TO IMPROVE INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE ACADEMIC GENERAL CENTRAL
LIBRARY IN POTSDAM IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT' TIME-CONSUMING QUERIES SHOULD BE
RECORDED ON SPECIAL FORMS, HERE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL; SELECTED FORMS FOR
ELABORATE QUERIES SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO A KEYWORD CATALOGUE FOR FUTURE
REFERENCE, THE CATALOGUE BEING DIVIDED INTO 2 FILES, 1 FOR TIME-CONSUMING
QUERIES AND 1 FOR BRIEF LITERATURE REFERENCES AND MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION
OFTEN REQUIRED; TOPICS MOST IN DEMAND SHOULD BE ASCERTAINED AND EVERY TOPIC
PUT INTO A CLASSIFIED LIST WHICH CAN THEN BE USED FOR STOCK EXPANSION; AND A
TELEPHONE INFORMATION SERVICE SHOULD BE INTRODUCED.
