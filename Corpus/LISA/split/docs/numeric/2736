REDUCING NOISE IN A COLLEGE LIBRARY.
     
INCREASING REPORTS OF NOISE IN THE LIBRARY OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK
COLLEGE AT CORTLAND PROMPTED INTEREST IN REDUCING NOISE LEVELS. CHAIRS, TABLES
AND CARRELS WERE ADJACENT AND FREQUENTLY ARRANGED IN CLUSTERS; PREVIOUS
RESEARCH INDICATED THAT SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT MAY INCREASE TALKING AND THUS
NOISE LEVELS. IT WAS HYPOTHESISED THAT DISASSEMBLING THE CLUSTERS AND
SEPARATING THE 3 TYPES OF FURNITURE WOULD REDUCE NOISE. A MULTIPLE BASELINE
DESIGN WAS USED WITH 2 MEASURES OF NOISE' AN ELECTROMECHANICAL (OBJECTIVE)
SYSTEM AND SUBJECTIVE RATINGS OF PERCEIVED NOISE. RESULTS SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE
DUE TO THE OBJECTIVE MEASURE BUT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN SUBJECTIVE RATINGS,
F(1,773)#8.80, P5.005. COMPARES THE UTILITY AND VALIDITY OF THE 2 MEASURES AND
DISCUSSES ISSUES IN NOISE CONTROL IN LIBRARIES.
