NEWSPAPERS AND HOME VIDEO INFORMATION SYSTEMS' THE PRESENT, THE PROMISE AND
THE PERIL.
     
THE WAYS IN WHICH NEWSPAPERS AND ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE CURRENTLY
COEXISTING AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY MAY AFFECT EACH OTHER IN THE FUTURE ARE
INVESTIGATED. AT PRESENT THERE EXISTS AN ATTITUDE WITHIN NEWSPAPERS THAT NEW
TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER. CABLE TELETEXT,
VIEWDATA, AND VIDEODISCS ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO NEWSPAPERS AND
INFORMATION STORAGE, AND TRANSMISSION. CONCERNING THE FUTURE, THE TYPE OF
INFORMATION WHICH MAY BE MORE SUITED TO ELECTRONIC THAN TRADITIONAL IS
CONSIDERED. LONG TERM EFFECTS ON NEWSPAPERS ARE DISCUSSED.
