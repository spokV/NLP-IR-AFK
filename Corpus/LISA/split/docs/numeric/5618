INDIAN CULTURAL CENTRE FOR CHILDREN.

DESCRIBES BAL BAHVAN ('CHILDREN'S HOUSE'), NEW DELHI, A CENTRE OF CREATIVITY
FOR ALL CHILDREN AGED 5-16, REGARDLESS OF CLASS OR CASTE. THE CENTRE, OPENED
IN 1956, IS A GOVERNMENT PROJECT AND SIMILAR CENTRES EXIST IN 15 OTHER STATES;
DELHI ALONE HAS 15 DISTRICT CENTRES. THERE IS A MEMBERSHIP FEE, ALTHOUGH
MATERIALS ARE FREE. 500-1,000 CHILDREN VISIT DAILY. CHILDREN CAN CHOOSE AMONG
SEVERAL ACTIVITY GROUPS. THE LIBRARY HAS 18,000 VOLUMES AND 67 JOURNALS. IT
HAS A CHILDREN'S SECTION AND A REFERENCE COLLECTION FOR TEACHERS. IT ALSO
SERVES THE NATIONAL CHILDREN'S MUSEUM, WHICH HAS A NEW EXHIBITION EVERY MONTH.
CONTROVERSIAL, SOCIO-POLITICAL QUESTIONS ARE AVOIDED AND IT IS DOUBTFUL
WHETHER THE AIM OF BRINGING DIFFERENT CASTES TOGETHER IS IN PRACTICE
FULFILLED.
