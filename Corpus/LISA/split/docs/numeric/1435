LIBRARY STOCK AS A SYSTEM OF PARTIAL BOOKSTOCKS.

IN A PARTICULAR LIBRARY THE BOOKSTOCK IS A HETEROGENOUS ENTITY WHICH CONSISTS
OF MATERIALS IN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND LANGUAGES, WITH DIFFERENT CHRONOLOGICAL
AND REGIONAL CONNOTATIONS WHICH SERVE A BROAD SPECTRUM OF READERS. THUS, THE
AVAILABLE BOOKSTOCK NATURALLY SUBDIVIDES INTO A NUMBER OF ENTITIES WHICH
BELONG TO THE SAME CATEGORY AND THE SUBJECT MATTER APPEARS TO BE THE MOST
IMPORTANT CRITERION. LARGE LIBRARIES IN SLOVAKIA E.G. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
HAVE SPECIFIC READING ROOMS FOR PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK E.G. NATURAL SCIENCES OR
LIBRARIANSHIP. SPECIAL PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK MAY CONSIST OF INTERNAL PUBLICATIONS
SUCH AS THESES, RESEARCH REPORTS, INTERNAL TRANSLATIONS AND OTHERS. IN DEALING
WITH PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK IT IS IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH THE TYPE OF READER USING
IT (E.G. CHILDREN), THE PHYSICAL FORM OF THE STOCK (TRADITIONAL OR MICRO),
GEOGRAPHICAL RELEVANCE AND THE FREQUENCY OF ITS USAGE. THE DIFFERENTIAL ASPECT
OF BOOKSTOCK IS WELL WORTH BEARING I N MIND FOR THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF
UTILISING LIBRARY RESOURCES.
