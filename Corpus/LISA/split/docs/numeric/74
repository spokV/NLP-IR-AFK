COUNTY LIBRARIES' REGIONAL SERVICE-PROBLEMS AND LINES OF DEVELOPMENT.

THE NORWEGIAN LIBRARY SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY IN A PHASE OF STAGNATION, PARTLY DUE
TO ECONOMIC FACTORS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES IN SEVERAL AREAS.
DISCUSSION CONTINUES ON THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISATION, AND A
RATIONALISATION PROGRAMME, NOW OVER 10 YEARS OLD, IS ATTEMPTING TO APPORTION
FUNCTIONS AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL
AUTHORITIES. COUNTY LIBRARIES, WITH THEIR TRIPLE TASK OF ADVISORY SERVICE,
INTER-LIBRARY LENDING, AND MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE, ARE PARTICULARLY
VULNERABLE. THESE SERVICES, WHICH BENEFIT PUBLIC LIBRARIES, SCHOOL LIBRARIES
AND INDIVIDUAL READERS, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SOME RATIONALISATION
PROPOSALS. THE FIRST 2 COULD BE MAINTAINED AND IMPROVED IF COUNTY LIBRARIES
WERE MADE NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ATTACHED TO LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES. MOBILE
SERVICES ARE POORLY DEVELOPED IN NORWAY, PARTLY BECAUSE NOT ALL AREAS ARE
GEOGRAPHICALLY SUITABLE. A RESTRUCTURING OF TH E COUNTRY'S LIBRARY SYSTEM IS
URGENTLY NEEDED, AND COUNTY LIBRARIANS MUST EVALUATE THEIR OWN POSITION AND
SERVICES.
