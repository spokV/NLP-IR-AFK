THE SYNERGISM OF USER NEEDS, SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS.
     
USER PERCEPTION OF DATA IMPORTANCE AND THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF HARDWARE
AND STORAGE DEVICES WILL DETERMINE THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF ON-LINE SYSTEMS. A
RETRIEVAL SYSTEM'S FUNCTIONS ARE ULTIMATELY DICTATED BY DATA BASE DESIGN.
EARLY ON-LINE SYSTEMS WERE DESIGNED FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION LIMITED TO
CITATIONS ONLY USING SEQUENTIAL FILES. NOW FULL TEXT INFORMATION, NUMERIC
INFORMATION, AND MANIPULATIVE SYSTEMS ARE BEING PERCEIVED BY A CLASS OF USERS
NOT INTERESTED IN SPECIALISED VOCABULARY SKILLS. THESE USERS ARE PLACING
DEMANDS THAT WILL REQUIRE SOPHISTICATED INTERNAL TECHNOLOGY, IMPROVED AND
EXPANDED STORAGE CAPABILITY, MORE SOPHISTICATED FILE STRUCTURE, AND
TRANSPARENT DATA MANIPULATIVE DEVICES. THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF THESE DEMANDS
WILL BRING ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW GENERATION OF MULTITIERED DATA BASES
THAT ALLOW USERS AT ALL SKILL LEVELS TO APPROACH THEM. THE POINT IS THAT, AS
THE USER'S NEED FOR TYPES OF DATA TO BE RETRIEVED CHANGES, SO MUST THE DATA
BASE TECHNOLOGY CHANGE. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
