USER FLUCTUATION AS THE TOTALITY OF USER MOVEMENT.
     
STATISTICS PRODUCED BY KOPENICK DISTRICT LIBRARY IN BERLIN BETWEEN 1969-79
SHOW THAT EACH YEAR A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF NEW USERS ARE REGISTERED ALTHOUGH
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF READERS GROWS ONLY SLOWLY. THESE FIGURES REFLECT NATIONAL
TRENDS. THE USE OF THE TERM FLUCTUATION IN THIS CONTEXT IS DISCUSSED. USERS
MAY LEAVE A LIBRARY FOR VARIOUS REASONS' UNAVOIDABLY, THROUGH ILLNESS OR
DEATH; FROM SOCIAL NECESSITY, AS WHEN TRANSFERRING FROM THE CHILDREN'S TO THE
ADULT LIBRARY; FOR SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE REASONS, E.G. MOVING HOUSE, MILITARY
SERVICE; UNDESIRABLY, BECAUSE THEY FIND THE LIBRARY SERVICE UNSATISFACTORY.
ANALYSIS OF ALL AVAILABLE STATISTICS SHOWS THAT 2/3 OF THE KOPENICK RESIDENTS
DO NOT USE THE LIBRARY AT ALL, WHICH AGAIN REFLECTS A NATIONAL TREND.
