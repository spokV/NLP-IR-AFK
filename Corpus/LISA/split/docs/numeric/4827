UNIMARC.
     
SEVERAL AGENCIES THAT WERE FORMERLY SATISFIED BY SINGLE CONVERSIONS FROM
ANOTHER FORMAT ARE BEGINNING TO REQUIRE DATA FROM MULTIPLE AGENCIES. EITHER
MULTIPLE CONVERSIONS MUST BE WRITTEN OR A SWITCH TO UNIMARC COULD TAKE PLACE.
THE COST SAVINGS WITH UNIMARC ARE OBVIOUS. MULTIPLE CONVERSIONS PROGRAMMES
REPRESENT A HIGH INITIAL INVESTMENT AND A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM IN KEEPING UP
WITH ALL OF THE CHANGES TO NECESSARILY DYNAMIC NATIONAL FORMATS. THE
INTRODUCTION OF AACR2 AND RESULTANT NATIONAL FORMAT CHANGES ARE AT THIS TIME
CAUSING SEVERAL AGENCIES TO REWRITE CONVERSION PROGRAMMES. A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO
A TRULY INTERNATIONAL UNIMARC EXCHANGE IS THAT THE CHANGE TAKES A JOINT
COMMITMENT SINCE AN AGENCY'S ABILITY TO RECEIVE UNIMARC RECORDS IS USELESS IF
THE SENDING AGENCY CANNOT SEND THEM. IFLA AND ITS MEMBERS NEED TO UNDERTAKE A
MAJOR EFFORT TO BRING A UNIMARC PROGRAMME INTO SERVICE.
