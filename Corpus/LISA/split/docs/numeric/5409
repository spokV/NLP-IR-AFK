A SYSTEM OF MEASURING THE DYNAMICS OF READING.

THE DYNAMICS OF READING CAN BE DEFINED AS CHANGES IN READING HABITS PRODUCED
AS A RESULT OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. THE LAST 15 YEARS HAVE SEEN MUCH RESEARCH
IN THIS FIELD, BUT ALL HAS BEEN RELATED TO SPECIFIC TIMES AND LOCATIONS. THERE
IS A GROWING NEED FOR A GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF REFERENCE, AND THIS PAPER
ATTEMPTS TO REVIEW SOME OF THE METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS INVOLVED. ONE SOLUTION
TO THE CHIEF PROBLEM, THAT OF MEASURING READING DYNAMICS, WAS SUGGESTED BY A
RESEARCH PROJECT AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY, WHICH DISCERNED 3 INDICATORS OF
CHANGE; PREVALENCE OF READING, ACTIVENESS AND CONTENT.
