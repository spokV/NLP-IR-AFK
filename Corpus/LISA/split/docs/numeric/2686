LOBBYING FOR LIBRARIES.
     
INTERVIEWS EILEEN COOKE, LEADER OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S
WASHINGTON OFFICE. THE OFFICE WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1945. IT HAS HELPED TO BRING
ABOUT THE LIBRARY SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT, WHICH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE BUILDING OF MANY NEW LIBRARIES. BUT THE PASSING OF THE ACT DOES NOT
ENSURE ACTUAL PAYMENT OF GRANTS TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES. FOR THIS TO HAPPEN,
PERSISTENT LOBBYING OF THE CONGRESS COMMITTEE IS NECESSARY. THE OFFICE KEEPS
INTERESTED CONGRESS REPRESENTATIVES INFORMED OF LIBRARY ISSUES, FOLLOWS THE
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN RELEVANT AREAS, AND BRIEFS MEMBERS BEFORE HEARINGS, BUT
IT IS NOT ALLOWED, NOR DOES IT SEEK TO, GIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO INDIVIDUAL
CANDIDATES' ELECTION CAMPAIGNS.
