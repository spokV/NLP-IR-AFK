REQUIREMENTS FOR AN EDUCATIONAL SATELLITE SYSTEM FOR SOUTH AMERICA.
     
THE NUMEROUS BENEFITS OF ESTABLISHING SATELLITE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN REALISED BY
THE NORTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND THE USSR. THERE IS NO DOUBT
THAT SOUTH AMERICA WILL SOON PARTICIPATE IN SATELLITE SYSTEMS. OF PRIMARY
IMPORTANCE NOW IS TO CONVINCE SOUTH AMERICA THAT A LOCALLY-CONSTRUCTED
EDUCATIONAL SATELLITE SYSTEM WOULD NOT IMPOSE FOREIGN CULTURAL DOMINATION, BUT
WOULD BE ONE OF THE BEST WAYS BY WHICH SOUTH AMERICANS COULD BE LIBERATED,
GIVING AN ECONOMIC SOLUTION TO THEIR GROWING EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS.
