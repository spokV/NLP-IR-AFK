WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES?.

THE NATIONAL NETWORK OF PUBLIC LIBRARY COOPERATION AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE IS
NOW WELL ESTABLISHED IN FINLAND. THE CENTRAL LIBRARY FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES WILL
BECOME OPERATIONAL IN 1981. THE WORK FOR A NETWORK FOR SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES
HAS NOT BEEN STARTED. THE 6 CENTRAL LIBRARIES ESTABLISHED SO FAR COVER ONLY
SOME SCIENCES AND NO EXTRA FUNDING HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR THIS NEW RESPONSIBILITY.
IN 1974 THE COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION GAVE THE BASIC MODEL FOR
ESTABLISHING A NETWORK FOR SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES. THIS WOULD INCLUDE A NATIONAL
LIBRARY, A CENTRE FOR INTERLENDING, AND CENTRAL LIBRARIES FOR DIFFERENT
SCIENCES. NO CENTRE FOR INTERLENDING EXISTS YET, AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF
THE HELSINKI UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AS A NATIONAL LIBRARY NEED CLARIFICATION.
