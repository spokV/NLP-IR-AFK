IRANIAN HEALTH SCIENCE LIBRARIES IN REVOLUTION.

ACCOUNT OF THE IMPACT OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION ON HEALTH SCIENCE LIBRARIES,
WITH BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THEIR PRE-REVOLUTIONARY STATUS. THE OVERALL EFFECT
OF THE REVOLUTION HAS BEEN MIXED, AND WHILST HEALTH SCIENCE LIBRARIANS ARE
ENCOURAGED BY EVIDENCE OF INCREASED DEMOCRACY IN LIBRARY MANAGEMENT, THEY WERE
DISAPPOINTED BY BUDGET CUTS AND PERSONNEL FREEZES. HOWEVER, SINCE THE
DEPARTURE OF THE MONARCHY, THEY HOPE FOR A MORE ENCOURAGING SITUATION IN THE
FUTURE.
