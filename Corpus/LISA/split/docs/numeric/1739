RESEARCH TECHNOLOGY' A STUDY OF THE SPREAD OF SPECTRAL METHODS BY ANALYSING
PUBLICATIONS.
     
SHOWS HOW AN ANALYSIS OF PARALLEL SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES CAN
INDICATE THE DYNAMICS OF THE SPREAD OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS, THE
LEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENT, AND THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENCE IN THOSE
COUNTRIES. USES THIS METHOD TO STUDY THE DYNAMICS OF THE SPREAD OF INFRARED
AND NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY AND MASS SPECTROMETRY IN THE UK,
USA, FRANCE, AND WEST GERMANY DURING 1960-77. ARTICLES IN 2JOURNAL OF ORGANIC
CHEMISTRY1 AND 2JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY1 ARE COMPARED TO
EVALUATE THE SPEED OF SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS TRANSFER FROM FUNDAMENTAL TO
APPLIED SCIENCE AND THE RATIO OF METHODS USED IN THE LATTER DISCIPLINE.
