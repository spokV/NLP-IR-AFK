THE START OF A TEACHER TRAINING COLLEGE LIBRARY.

FROM JAN 81 JONSTRUP TEACHER TRAINING COLLEGE HAS HAD A PROFESSIONAL LIBRARY
SERVICE IN CONJUNCTION WITH LYNGBY PUBLIC LIBRARY. A LIBRARIAN FROM THE
LIBRARY HAS BEEN STATIONED AT, AND PAID BY, THE COLLEGE SINCE OCT 80. A
LIBRARY COMMITTEE OF TEACHING STAFF, STUDENTS AND LIBRARIANS WAS SET UP TO
ANALYSE THE COLLEGE'S NEEDS AS REGARDS LIBRARY SERVICES IN GENERAL AND A
PROJECT DUE TO START IN 1981 IN PARTICULAR. IT WAS AGREED THAT A LARGE
CENTRALLY PLACED LIBRARY WAS NEEDED FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS, THAT LYNGBY
LIBRARY WOULD MAKE ABOUT 10% OF ANNUAL ACCESSIONS READY FOR LENDING, AND THAT
LIBRARY STAFF WOULD BE AVAILABLE 4 HOURS DAILY. THE PRESENT STOCK WAS TO BE
EXAMINED FOR POSSIBLE WITHDRAWAL OR RETENTION AND REGISTRATION. EXTRA STAFF
WAS SECURED FOR THE ORGANISATION OF THE LIBRARY AND TRANSFER OF MATERIAL FROM
THE SPECIAL SUBJECT AREAS TO THE LIBRARY.
