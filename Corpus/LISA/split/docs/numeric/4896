A MATHEMATICAL APPROACH TO RELATIONS IN THESAURI.
     
PRESENTS A BRIEF BACKGROUND OF SET THEORY AND RELATIONS INCLUDING EQUIVALENCE
AND ORDERING RELATIONS. PROPOSES 4 WORKING HYPOTHESES CONCERNED WITH THESAURI
RELATIONS. EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITY OF GENERATING AN EQUIVALENCE CLASS OF
DESCRIPTORS FROM A SINGLE DESCRIPTOR TO AID INFORMATION/DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL.
PROVIDES A NEW MATHEMATICAL APPROACH TO A THESAURUS AND ITS RELATIONS AND
COMPARES IT AGAINST THE TRADITIONAL WAY OF REPRESENTING A THESAURUS. PROPOSES
NEW AREAS FOR INVESTIGATION IN THIS DIRECTION.
