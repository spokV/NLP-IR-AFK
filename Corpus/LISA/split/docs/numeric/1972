THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE OF LOCAL HISTORY BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
     
SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II, MUCH GREATER ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO LOCAL
HISTORY IN BULGARIA THAN WAS PREVIOUSLY THE CASE. STAFF IN THE REGIONAL
CENTRAL LIBRARIES HAVE MADE A GREAT EFFORT TO PRODUCE AND PUBLISH RELEVANT
BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND OTHER MATERIAL DEALING WITH THE PAST AND PRESENT OF THEIR
PARTICULAR REGIONS. AS A RULE, SIGNIFICANT POLITICIANS AND POLITICAL EVENTS
ARE WELL COVERED BY SUCH PUBLICATIONS, AS ARE WRITERS AND OTHER PROMINENT
PEOPLE WHO EITHER LIVE OR LIVED IN THE REGION, OR WHO WERE BORN THERE, BUT WHO
ARE NOW MORE WIDELY KNOWN. NAMES OF NUMEROUS PUBLICATIONS ARE GIVEN, WHICH CAN
BE CONSIDERED VALUABLE AIDS TO THOSE STUDYING LOCAL HISTORY. TOPICS DEALING,
FOR INSTANCE, WITH THE REGIONS' ECONOMY, CULTURAL LIFE, HEALTH SERVICE, ARTS
AND OTHER ASPECTS MUST NOT BE NEGLECTED, AS PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW OF SOCIAL AND
OTHER CHANGES IN THEIR SURROUNDINGS. GRADUALLY, THE INFORMATION GIVEN SHOULD
BE EXTENDED TO INCLUDE SMA LLER AND/OR SPECIALISED SECTIONS OF THE REGION,
SUCH AS TOWNS AND PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES.
