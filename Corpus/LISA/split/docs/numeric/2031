THOMAS GREENWOOD' PUBLIC LIBRARY ENTHUSIAST.
     
THOMAS GREENWOOD (1851-1908) WAS BORN INTO POVERTY AND HARDSHIP; MADE THE MOST
OF HIS EDUCATION BY READING EXTENSIVELY AND LATER ATTENDING A MUTUAL
IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY; AND EVENTUALLY BECAME A SUCCESSFUL PUBLISHER OF TECHNICAL
BOOKS AND PERIODICALS. WISHING TO HELP OTHERS MAKE THE BEST OF THEIR LIVES,
HIS MAIN PREOCCUPATION WAS WITH PUBLIC LIBRARIES BECAUSE IN THEM HE DISCOVERED
AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION WHICH REFLECTED MANY OF HIS OWN IDEALS. FOR MUCH OF
HIS LIFE, HE GAVE UNSPARINGLY HIS TIME, MONEY, AND ENERGY TO THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY MOVEMENT.
