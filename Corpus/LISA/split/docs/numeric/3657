IMPACT OF OTHER DISCIPLINES ON INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO ANALYSE THE IMPACT OF IDEAS
ORIGINATING FROM WITHIN LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND THOSE FROM
OTHER DISCIPLINES. 12 MOST CITED JOURNALS IN LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL (SOURCE SPECIALTIES) WERE CHOSEN FOR CITATION ANALYSIS. FROM THESE
JOURNALS, 40 ARTICLES WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM THE LAST COMPLETE YEAR AND
THEIR REFERENCES RECORDED, RESULTING IN 1,159 CITATIONS. THE ANALYSIS
CONSISTED OF MEASUREMENTS OF SELF-CITATION, CROSS-FERTILISATION (PROPORTION OF
CITATIONS MADE BY ONE TO THE OTHER SOURCE SPECIALTY), AND OPENNESS (THE DEGREE
TO WHICH A SPECIALTY IS OPEN TO THE IDEAS OF OTHER DISCIPLINES). REPORT NOT
AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
