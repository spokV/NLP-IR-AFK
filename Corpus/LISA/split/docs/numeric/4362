WARNER-LAMBERT/PARKE-DAVIS-CAS REGISTRY III INTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEM.
     
THE CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) REGISTRY III RECORDS OF CHEMICAL
STRUCTURE ARE USED TO AUGMENT THE WARNER-LAMBERT/PARKE-DAVIS (WL/PD) COMPUTER
FILES OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DATA. ENTRY OF DATA AT WL/PD IS PARALLELED BY
ENTRY OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES AND NAMES AT CAS, WHICH THEN SENDS THE
COMPUTER-READABLE RECORDS TO WL/PD. WL/PD USES INQUIRE SOFTWARE WHICH PROVIDES
INTERACTIVE OR BATCH MULTIFILE SEARCH CAPABILITIES AND ROUTINE REPORT
GENERATION. BATCH PROCESSING IS USED FOR SUBSTRUCTURE SEARCHING AND
HIGH-QUALITY PRINTING OF STRUCTURES AND NAMES.
