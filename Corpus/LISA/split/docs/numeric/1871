LOCAL NEWSPAPER INDEXING' A PUBLIC LIBRARY REPORTS ITS EXPERIENCE.
     
DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER INDEXING
PROJECT IN PROGRESS AT THE NAPA CITY-COUNTY LIBRARY IN CALIFORNIA. THE INDEX
ENCOMPASSES 2 SETS OF NEWSPAPERS-SELECTED PAPERS FROM 1857 TO 1900, AND A
CURRENT DAILY NEWSPAPER. THE 2 INDEXES HAVE DIFFERENT SCOPES AND ARE HOUSED
SEPARATELY, BUT SHARE A COMMON SUBJECT AUTHORITY FILE AND FORMAT. AN INDEXER'S
MANUAL WAS DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE A PORTABLE AUTHORITY FILE, AND TO INSTRUCT
INDEXERS ON INDEXING PRINCIPLES, SCOPE RULES, AND DIFFICULT COMPONENTS.
DISCUSSES BRIEFLY SOME OF THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE INDEX.
