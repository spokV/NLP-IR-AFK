STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING UTILIZATION OF COMPUTERIZED STATISTICAL DATA BY THE
SOCIAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.
     
IN RECENT DECADES THERE HAS BEEN A NOTABLE EXPANSION OF STATISTICAL DATA
PRODUCED BY THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE, RESEARCH,
POLICY AND EVALUATION PROGRAMMES. THIS IS DUE TO ADVANCES IN RELATIVELY
INEXPENSIVE AND EFFICIENT DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF COMPUTER-READABLE
STATISTICAL DATA. CORRESPONDING CHANGES HAVE NOT OCCURRED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF
DATA COLLECTION, PRESERVATION, DESCRIPTION AND DISSEMINATION. AS A RESULT, THE
PROCESS BY WHICH DATA BECOME ACCESSIBLE TO SOCIAL RESEARCHERS AND OTHERS IS
FRUSTRATING, TIME CONSUMING, AND INEFFICIENT. DESCRIBES THE REASONS FOR THIS
SITUATION' THE PROBLEM-SOLVING WORKSTYLE OF SOCIAL DATA USERS, THE NATURE OF
THE DATA AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, AND AN INCHOATE SOCIAL
SCIENCE INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE.
