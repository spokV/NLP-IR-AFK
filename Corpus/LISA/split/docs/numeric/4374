FEES FOR ONLINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH SERVICES IN PUBLICLY-SUPPORTED LIBRARIES.
     
ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCHING IS AN IMPORTANT RECENT INNOVATION IN LIBRARY
SERVICES. THE CHOICES THAT LIBRARIES HAVE MADE IN ADOPTING THIS SERVICE HAVE
IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE LIBRARY SERVICES. THEIR DECISIONS ABOUT
WHETHER, WHEN, AND HOW TO CHARGE THE USER REVEAL THEIR JUDGEMENTS ABOUT THE
APPROPRIATE ROLE OF USER FEES. THE WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIES HAVE INTEGRATED
ON-LINE SEARCHING INTO MORE TRADITIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR
FUTURE TECHNOLOGY-BASED INNOVATIONS. A CALIFORNIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION SURVEY
OF PUBLICLY-SUPPORTED LIBRARIES FOUND A LARGE NUMBER OFFERING SEARCHES, NEARLY
HALF AT NO CHARGE TO THE USERS; AND THAT USER FEES DIFFERED ACCORDING TO WHERE
THE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED AND WHETHER THE USER OR THE LIBRARIAN WAS SEEN AS ITS
PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC LIBRARIES APPEARED TO HAVE 2
DIFFERENT SERVICE PATTERNS.
