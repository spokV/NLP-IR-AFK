HARRISON'S MODEL OF GROUP DECISION MAKING IS DESCRIBED AND DISCUSSED IN TERMS
OF ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DECISIONS LIBRARIANS AND OTHER INFORMATION
MANAGERS ARE CALLED UPON TO MAKE. ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO QUESTIONS OF DECISION

BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE GROUP DECISION MAKING, BROADENING THE INFORMATION
RESOURCE BASE THEY AND THEIR CLIENTS USE IN DECISION MAKING, DESIGNING
INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO FACILITATE DECISION MAKING, AND RAISING THE VISIBILITY
OF THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCES AS CONTRIBUTING DISCIPLINES TO THE
DECISION SCIENCES.
