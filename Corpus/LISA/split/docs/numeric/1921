EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF INFORMATION SPECIALISTS IN DATA BASE UTILIZATION.
     
THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF MACHINE-READABLE DATA BASES AND ON-LINE SEARCH
SYSTEMS DEPENDS TO A GREAT EXTENT ON PEOPLE'S AWARENESS OF THEM. EDUCATION AND
TRAINING PROGRAMMES IN DATA BASE UTILISATION MUST EMPHASIZE BOTH AN
UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHARACTERISTICS AND STRUCTURE OF THE DATA BASES AND
EXPERIENCE IN USING ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. EFFECTIVE TEACHING METHODS
INCLUDE THE USE OF PRINTED MATERIALS, DEMONSTRATIONS, AUDIO-VISUAL AIDS, AND
COMPUTER-ASSISTED INSTRUCTION AT THE TERMINAL.
