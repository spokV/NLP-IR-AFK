NUMERIC DATABASES: TOO MANY OR NOT ENOUGH STATISTICAL DATA?.
     
HISTORICALLY THE 1ST NUMERICAL DATA BASES WERE ORGANISED TO MEET A SPECIFIC
DEMAND BY SUPPLYING ECONOMISTS WITH BASIC STATISTICAL DATA TOGETHER WITH
COMPUTERISED TOOLS IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE THE RETRIEVAL DATA. DATA WERE
GATHERED FROM ANY STANDARD OR READILY-AVAILABLE SOURCE. SOME VERY USABLE DATA
BASES WERE SOLD BY THEIR PRODUCERS TO BE OFFERED TO ON-LINE SEARCHERS. MANY
DATA BASES DISPLAY STRONG SIMILARITIES, OFFERING THE SAME INFORMATION, WHILE
IN OTHER FIELDS, FOR MANY COUNTRIES, INFORMATION IS SCARCE IF AT ALL
AVAILABLE.
