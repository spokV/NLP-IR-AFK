A NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE' PURPOSE AND FUNCTIONS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO
ZAMBIA.

(MLS THESIS.) EXAMINES CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING NATIONAL LIBRARY
SERVICES, INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS, AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN AFRICA,
ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN, CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN REGION, AGAINST THE
BACKGROUND OF DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN ZAMBIA. THE ZAMBIAN DEVELOPMENTS ARE SHOWN
TO BE INADEQUATE AND TOO UNCOORDINATED AND THE COUNTRY'S PRESENT LIBRARY
SERVICES ARE CLAIMED NOT TO BE SUFFICIENTLY ORIENTED TOWARDS MEETING NATIONAL
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ASPIRATIONS. A NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE IS DESIGNED WHICH
WILL (1) MEET ZAMBIA'S SPECIFIC NEEDS AND (2) CO-EXIST SMOOTHLY WITH NATIONAL
LIBRARY SERVICES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.
