THE FACULTY PARTICIPATION IN THE CHOICE CARD SELECTION' A SURVEY OF THEIR
REACTIONS IN A LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE.

REPORT OF A STUDY TO INVESTIGATE THE BEHREND COLLEGE, PENNSYLVANIA STATE
UNIVERSITY, PARTICIPATION IN THE CHOICE CARD SELECTION. A 3-MONTH OBSERVATION
OF THE FACULTY RESPONSE TO THE CHOICE CARD DISTRIBUTION REVEALED THAT IT TOOK
4-14 DAYS FOR FACULTY MEMBERS TO RETURN CARDS; RETURN RATE IS VERY HIGH; AND
PERCENTAGE OF BOOKS SELECTED VARIES BY DISCIPLINE. INTERVIEWS WITH FACULTY
MEMBERS SHOWED THAT CHOICE CARDS WERE FELT TO BE INFORMATIVE AND UP TO DATE.
BOOK REVIEWS ARE HELPFUL ALTHOUGH SOME SUSPECTED THEIR RELIABILITY. IT WAS
RECOMMENDED THAT EACH TITLE BE REVIEWED BY 2 QUALIFIED REVIEWERS, AND THAT THE
LIBRARY SHOULD CONTINUE TO USE THE CARDS.
