THE BOOK AND ITS MIRROR: ADVERTISING FOR BOOKS.
     
EXTRACT FROM A STUDY PREPARED DURING 1979-80 FOR THE FRENCH ECOLE NATIONALE
SUPERIEURE DE BIBLIOTHECAIRES. SURVEYS THE VARIOUS WAYS FRENCH PUBLISHERS TRY
TO BRING NEW BOOKS TO THE ATTENTION OF POTENTIAL BUYERS' PUBLICITY LAUNCHES IN
BOOKSHOPS, DIRECT MAILING, MEDIA REVIEWS AND ADVERTISING, AND WALL POSTERS.
NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS ARE THE MOST FAVOURED FORM; DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF HOW
ADVERTISEMENTS ARE DESIGNED, WHERE THEY ARE PLACED, AND COSTS. THE TECHNICAL
AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVICES USED IN COMPOSING THESE ADVERTISEMENTS ARE EXAMINED
IN DETAIL, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO LAYOUT, THE RELATION BETWEEN VISUAL
AND VERBAL ELEMENTS, AND APPEAL TO CONSUMER VALUES. IN CONCLUSION, SOME
COMPARISON IS MADE BETWEEN PUBLISHERS WHO CREATE PUBLICITY TO PROMOTE SPECIFIC
TITLES, AND THOSE WHO EMPHASISE PRIMARILY THE REPUTATION OF THE PUBLISHING
HOUSE ITSELF.
