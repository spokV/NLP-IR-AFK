GIVE THE PART-TIME LIBRARIAN A CHANCE.
     
A TALK GIVEN TO THE ASSOCIATION OF PART-TIME LIBRARIANS, GROUP C OF THE DANISH
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, AT ITS 25 YEARS' JUBILEE, OCT 81, BY A FORMER CHAIRMAN.
WHEN THE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED IN 1956, AS AN ASSOCIATION OF PARISH
LIBRARIANS, THE POSITION AS PART-TIME LIBRARIAN WAS USUALLY HONORARY AND
UNPAID, A FACT WHICH CAUSED LACK OF ESTEEM FOR THE JOB. THERE WAS LITTLE
INTEREST IN MEMBERSHIP AND THE ASSOCIATION HAD TO BE FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED BY
THE GROUP OF PARISH LIBRARY COMMITTEES, THE MEMBERS' EMPLOYERS. HOSTILITY HAS
BEEN MET FROM THE LIBRARIANS' ASSOCIATION AND LATER THE LIBRARIANS' UNION,
UNNECESSARILY, AS THE PART-TIME LIBRARIANS ON THE WHOLE RECOGNISE THE ULTIMATE
GOAL OF FULL-TIME LIBRARIES STAFFED BY PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS, BUT INSIST ON
SATISFACTORY TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THERE SHOULD BE A CHANCE FOR PART-TIME
LIBRARIANS THROUGH SUPPLEMENTARY COURSES TO QUALIFY AS LIBRARIANS, AND IT IS
POSSIBLE FOR THE PROFESSIONALS AND THE NON-PROFESS IONALS TO WORK SIDE BY SIDE.
