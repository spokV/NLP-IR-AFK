THE EXTENSION OF COMPUTER INTELLIGENCE.
     
THE RATE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WILL BE ACCELERATED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF
MICROPROCESSORS. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT WILL LEAD TO THE INTEGRATION AND
EXTENSION OF MANY OF THE TOOLS OF TODAY. A COROLLARY OF THIS WILL BE THAT THE
INTELLIGENCE OF THE LARGE COMPUTERS WILL NOW APPEAR IN OTHER ITEMS OF
EQUIPMENT WITHIN THE OFFICE ENVIRONMENT.
