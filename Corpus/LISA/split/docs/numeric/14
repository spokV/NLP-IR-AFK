IFLA CHALLENGES TO ACTION IN THE YEAR OF THE DISABLED.

THE 46TH IFLA CONFERENCE (MANILA, AUG 80), THE 1ST HELD IN A DEVELOPING
COUNTRY, AROUSED UNUSUAL INTEREST AMONG FILIPINO LIBRARIANS AND MEDIA. IFLA'S
OBJECTIVES OF EXTENDING INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING, COOPERATION, DEBATE,
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN ALL FIELDS OF LIBRARIANSHIP, CURRENTLY THROUGH ITS
PROGRAMMES UNIVERSAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL AND UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF
PUBLICATIONS WAS EMPHASISED. ACCESS TO INFORMATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR A
COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, FINAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS
RESTING WITH THE GOVERNMENT. WHILE THE YEAR OF THE CHILD MUST BE FOLLOWED UP
ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE YEAR OF THE DISABLED IS A REMINDER
THAT HANDICAPPED PEOPLE IN ALL COUNTRIES LACK EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES WITH OTHER
READING GROUPS. WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES MUST NOT INHIBIT THE SEARCH
FOR NEW IDEAS. CHALLENGES ALL LIBRARY ORGANISATIONS TO FOCUS ATTENTION IN 1981
PARTICULARLY ON THE LIBRARY NEED OF BLIND AND OTHER HANDICAPPED READERS.
