INFORMATION BROKING IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY.
     
A REVIEW IS GIVEN OF THE UNDERDEVELOPED INFORMATION BROKING BUSINESS IN WEST
GERMANY. THE SITUATION IS CHARACTERISED BY A LACK OF PRIVATE INITIATIVES AND
AN ARRAY OF PUBLIC SECTOR SERVICES WHICH ARE USEFUL BUT INSUFFICIENT TO MEET
THE NEED OF THE INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
BROKING AGENCIES SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED.
