STATE-OF-THE-ART REPORT ON STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY METHODS DEVELOPMENT.

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE THE AGENCY WITH THE
TECHNICAL BASIS FOR ESTIMATING THE TOXICITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOUR OF
ORGANIC CHEMICALS FROM MOLECULAR STRUCTURE. THE PROJECT IS DIRECTED TOWARD THE
EVALUATION OF QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS (QSAR) FOR USE BY
EPA PROGRAM OFFICES AND TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DATA AND QSAR METHODS TO
EXTEND THE TECHNIQUE TO MEET AGENCY NEEDS. SPECIFICALLY, THE OBJECTIVE OF THE
STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP METHODS TO PREDICT THE TOXICITY,
PERSISTENCE, AND TREATABILITY OF LARGE NUMBERS OF UNTESTED CHEMICALS USING
QSAR BASED ON STRUCTURAL, CHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF
REPRESENTATIVE REFERENCE DATA BASES.
