THE CHINESE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCENE' REFLECTIONS ON A VISIT TO CHINA IN
JUNE 80.
     
IMPRESSIONS GAINED DURING AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO CHINA IN JUNE 80. CHINA HAS A
FEW VERY LARGE LIBRARIES WITH STRONG COLLECTIONS AND GENEROUS FUNDING. MANY
OTHER LIBRARIES HAVE SERIOUS GAPS IN THEIR COLLECTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE
CULTURAL REVOLUTION. THE EMPHASIS IS ON ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES-THERE
SEEM TO BE NO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. SERVICES ARE UNDEVELOPED, BUILDINGS AND
EQUIPMENT ARE NOT OF A HIGH QUALITY, THERE IS NO PLANNED INTERLENDING SYSTEM
OR LIBRARY COORDINATION, AND MOST RESEARCH IS CONCERNED WITH AUTOMATION AND
INFORMATION SYSTEMS RATHER THAN LIBRARIANSHIP. THE CHINESE WISH TO SOLVE THEIR
PROBLEMS THEMSELVES, ALTHOUGH THEY WELCOME HELP. THE WHOLE SITUATION IS IN A
STATE OF RAPID CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT.
