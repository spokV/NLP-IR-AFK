POETRY, COFFEE AND CAKES: POETRY CAFE OSTERGARD.
     
DESCRIBES THE EFFORTS OF HALMSTAD PUBLIC LIBRARY TO PROMOTE POETRY. SWEDISH
PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACQUIRE VERY LITTLE POETRY, AND POETRY EVENINGS ARE AN
EXCEPTION. POETRY CAFE OSTERGARD BEGAN IN AUTUMN 80 WITH EVENING GATHERINGS
HELD IN HALMSTAD'S BRANCH LIBRARY IN OSTERGARD SCHOOL. THE AIM WAS NOT TO
REPLACE HALMSTAD CENTRAL LIBRARY'S AUTHOR EVENINGS, BUT TO COMPLEMENT THEM
WITH ACTIVITIES IN A BRANCH LIBRARY. NEW FORMS WERE SOUGHT WHICH INVOLVED THE
PARTICIPANTS IN ACTIVE LISTENING AND CONVERSATION. A CAFE ATMOSPHERE WITH
COFFEE AND CAKES WAS CREATED. MANY OF THE POETS LIVED LOCALLY. THE LIBRARY
PRINTS POSTERS AND ADVERTISES IN THE LOCAL PRESS AND RADIO PRIOR TO EACH
EVENING AND PREPARES FREE FOLDERS WITH POEMS AND INTRODUCTIONS TO THE POETS.
EMPHASISES THAT THERE MUST BE CONTINUITY THROUGH REGULAR ACTIVITIES AND THAT
MORE PERSONAL CONTACT TO PROMOTE THE EVENINGS AND MORE PARTICIPATION BY
AMATEUR POETS ARE NEEDED IF THE CAFE IS TO CONT INUE.
