OCLC SEARCH KEY USAGE IN A LARGE RESEARCH LIBRARY.
     
MANY LIBRARIES USE THE OCLC ONLINE UNION CATALOG AND SHARED CATALOGING
SUBSYSTEM TO PERFORM VARIOUS LIBRARY FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS ACQUISITIONS AND
CATALOGUING. AS AN INITIAL PART OF THE OPERATION, USERS MUST SEARCH AND
RETRIEVE A BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORD FOR AN ITEM FROM THE LARGE OCLC DATA BASE.
VARIOUS TYPES OF DERIVED SEARCH KEY ARE AVAILABLE FOR RETRIEVAL. THIS STUDY OF
ACTUAL SEARCH KEYS ENTERED BY ON-LINE USERS OF OCLC WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE
THE TYPES OF SEARCH KEY USERS PREFER FOR PERFORMING VARIOUS LIBRARY OPERATIONS
AND TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE PREFERRED SEARCH KEYS ARE EFFECTIVE.
