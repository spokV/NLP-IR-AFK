INFORMATION PROCESSING IN INDUSTRIAL CONCERNS.
     
DISCUSSES A THESIS BY J. LUEF' STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION IN
INDUSTRIAL CONCERNS, PRESENTED TO THE DANISH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY. THE PROBLEM
OF HOW KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR SELECTION OF MATERIAL FOR
CONSTRUCTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED IN DATA FORM IS NOW
INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED WITH THE CREATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF
SCIENTIFIC UNIONS' COMMITTEE FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL DATA. LUEF
DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN RETRIEVAL OF REFERENCES AND OF DATA; VERY DETAILED
SPECIFICATIONS ARE NEEDED TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL OBJECTS SO THAT THEY CAN BE
REFERRED TO IN A SYSTEM. HE STUDIES THE AREA OF ANTICIPATIVE INTELLIGENCE,
I.E. THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING NEW SOLUTIONS TO A PROBLEM AND THEREBY
INCREASE INNOVATION WITHIN THE FIRM. THE THEORETICAL DISCUSSIONS ARE SOUNDLY
BASED ON PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE AND HE REGARDS THE PROCESS OF RETRIEVAL AS A
TOOL TO BE USED BY THE DECISION-MAKER. THE THESIS HAS SECTIONS ON SOFTWARE AND
 HARDWARE, INCLUDING DISCUSSION OF THE ROLE OF MAN IN THE SEARCH PROCESS. THE
2ND PART CONCERNS PRACTICAL SYSTEM DESIGN IN 4 CONCERNS AND DESCRIPTION OF A
DEMONSTRATION SYSTEM DART (DATA ANALYSIS, RETRIEVAL AND TAXONOMY), WITH
COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.
