SWITCHING ON THE ELECTRONIC LIBRARY.

BRIEFLY DISCUSSES THE COST OF USING 'ELECTRONIC LIBRARIES' (DATA BASES) AND
EXPLAINS WHY IT IS WORTH THE EXPENSE IN 3 AREAS-PATENTS, MEDICAL AND CHEMICAL

IN A DATA BASE SEARCH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF USER-FRIENDLY ALMOST-FOOLPROOF
COMPUTER SYSTEMS. CONCLUDES THAT, DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES, THESE ELECTRONIC
LIBRARIES ARE STILL MUCH MORE CONVENIENT THAN SYSTEMS SUCH AS PRESTEL.
