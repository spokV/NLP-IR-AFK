CHILDREN IN HOSPITAL.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN. FOR
HOSPITALISED CHILDREN THE LIBRARY FUNCTIONS AS A PLACE FOR
RECREATION-SOMEWHERE ALLOWING THEM RESPITE FROM BEING REGARDED PRIMARILY AS
PATIENTS. LIBRARIANS WORKING IN HOSPITALS SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE UNIQUE
POSSIBILITY THEY HAVE OF REACHING AND STIMULATING CHILDREN WHO WOULD SELDOM
VISIT A PUBLIC LIBRARY UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES.
