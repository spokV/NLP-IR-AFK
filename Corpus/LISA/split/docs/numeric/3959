USE OF JOIS AT TOKYO WOMEN'S MEDICAL COLLEGE LIBRARY.
     
SINCE THE COMPUTERISED RETRIEVAL SERVICE, JOIS, WAS MADE AVAILABLE AT TOKYO
WOMEN'S MEDICAL COLLEGE IN APR 79, THE NUMBER OF LITERATURE RETRIEVAL REQUESTS
INCREASED BY MORE THAN 100%. HOWEVER, MANUAL LITERATURE SEARCHES USING
JAPANESE INDEXING JOURNALS ARE STILL BEING CONTINUED FOR 2 REASONS' (1)
ON-LINE DATA BASES INCLUDED IN JOIS ONLY COVER THE LAST 5 YEARS OF LITERATURE;
(2) JAPANESE LITERATURE IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED. OF THE DATA BASES AVAILABLE
ON JOIS, MEDLARS WAS USED THE MOST, FOLLOWED BY TOXLINE. THE AVERAGE SEARCH
TIME WAS 7 MINUTES FOR ALL DATA BASES. 3 MEDLARS SEARCH SAMPLES ARE SHOWN.
