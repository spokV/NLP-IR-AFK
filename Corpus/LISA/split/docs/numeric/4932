USING THE TEXT TELEPHONE-SOMETHING FOR LIBRARIES?.
     
DESCRIBES THE TEXT TELEPHONE INSTALLED IN LANDSKRONA PUBLIC LIBRARY EARLY IN
1981 FOR THE USE OF THE DEAF AND SPEECH IMPAIRED. IT CONSISTS OF 3 UNITS' AN
ORDINARY TELEPHONE, A KEYBOARD USED TO TYPE THE TEXT, AND A SCREEN MONITOR,
WHICH RECEIVES AND TRANSMITS THE TEXT. THE HANDICAPPED PERSON NEEDS ALSO A
SIGNAL RELAY, WHICH TRANSFORMS THE AUDIBLE TELEPHONE SIGNALS TO VISUAL
SIGNALS, AND HE MUST BE ABLE TO TYPE AS THE KEYBOARD IS THAT OF A STANDARD
TYPEWRITER. DISABLED PEOPLE CAN CONTACT OTHERS WITH SIMILAR EQUIPMENT, BUT
CONTACT TO AN ORDINARY TELEPHONE REQUIRES A TRANSFORMER. THE TELEPHONE
DIRECTORY HAS SPECIAL MARKINGS FOR TEXT TELEPHONES. EXPANSION OF THE SERVICE,
WHICH PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH NEW AND ISOLATED GROUPS, HAS BEEN
LIMITED BY LACK OF FINANCE.
