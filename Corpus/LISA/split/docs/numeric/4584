HAS THE DISCUSSION ABOUT SCHOOL LIBRARIES FINISHED?.
     
SINCE THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY, THE VALUE OF A CENTRALLY SITUATED SCHOOL LIBRARY
OPEN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND ENCOURAGING A LIFE-LONG LEARNING PROCESS HAS
BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED. THE DISCUSSION RECEIVED FRESH IMPETUS AFTER 1970 WITH
THE DEVELOPMENT OF USA, UK AND SCANDINAVIAN SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRES AND RENEWED
INTEREST IN THE SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL FUNCTIONS OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
CLASSROOMS MUST BE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRE; THEIR
EVOLUTION INTO CLASS MEDIA CENTRES HAS ONLY OCCURRED SO FAR IN PRIMARY
SCHOOLS, A CHANGE DEMANDING GOOD ORGANISATION AND CLOSE LINKS WITH THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE TRIANGULAR RELATIONSHIP CLASSROOM-SCHOOL MEDIA
CENTRE-PUBLIC LIBRARY CAN BE EQUATED WITH EMUNDS' '3-TIER' LIBRARY SYSTEM;
EACH COMPONENT MUST HAVE ITS TASKS CLEARLY DEFINED.
