MAKE FRIENDS WITH YOUR LIBRARY': A REPORT OF A PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN IN BURY,
LANCASHIRE.D

ESCRIBES A PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN BY BURY LIBRARIES (UK) 'TO BRING BEFORE THE
PUBLIC THE IDEAS THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE IMPORTANT CENTRES IN THE COMMUNITY
AND HAVE A MUCH WIDER ROLE THAN IS COMMONLY THOUGHT'. POSTERS AND HANDOUTS
FORMED THE BASIS OF THE MONTH-LONG CAMPAIGN, PLUS NEWSPAPER ARTICLES, ALTHOUGH
THESE WERE LIMITED BY A PRINTING STRIKE. THE EXPERIENCE OF GOING INTO SHOPPING
CENTRES WAS VERY USEFUL.
