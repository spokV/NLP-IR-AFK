COMPUTER NETWORKS SYSTEMS' THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON CO-OPERATIVE
INTERLENDING IN THE USA.
     
REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON NATIONAL
DOCUMENT PROVISION, BOSTON SPA, 22-24 SEPT 80. RECENT US DEVELOPMENTS HAVE
FAVOURED DECENTRALISED NETWORKS RATHER THAN CENTRALISED RESOURCE LIBRARIES. US
LIBRARIES LACK CENTRAL PLANNING AND FUNDING, AND PROGRESS DEPENDS ON
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY INITIATIVES. IN THE LAST 10 YEARS THIS HAS RESULTED IN
OCLC, RLG, WLN AND 20 REGIONAL NETWORKS. DESCRIBES THE 3 MAJOR COMPUTER
COMPUTER UTILITIES. THESE COMPUTER NETWORKS WOULD BE COMPLEMENTED NOT
DUPLICATED BY CENTRAL RESOURCE LIBRARIES; WITH THE NATIONAL PERIODICALS CENTER
EFFECTIVELY SHELVED, THE CENTER FOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES COULD ASSUME A MORE
DYNAMIC ROLE. COMMERCIAL VENDORS ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED, BUT ARE AN IMPORTANT
ELEMENT IN DOCUMENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS. THEY ARE COMPLETELY OUTSIDE CONVENTIONAL
LIBRARY SYSTEMS, AND MIGHT CREAM OFF THE PROFITABLE END OF THE DOCUMENT SUPPLY
MARKET .
