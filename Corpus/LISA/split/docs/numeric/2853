MANAGEMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF STOCK CONTROL IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
     
EXAMINES THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE-SCALE RELEGATION OF BOOKS FROM
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. INDICATORS OF USE AND NON-USE ARE DEVELOPED FOR GENERAL
APPLICATION. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE RELEGATION OF PERIODICALS IS CONSIDERABLY
LESS EXPENSIVE BOTH IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT OF EFFORT AND SPACE RELEASED THAN
THE RELEGATION OF MONOGRAPHS. THE RELEVANCE TO A LOCAL LIBRARY SITUATION OF
BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING DIVISION DATA ON PERIODICAL USAGE IS VINDICATED.
