MONITORING THE DEMAND FOR THE SERVICES OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES-THE SURVEY AS A
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT TOOL FOR CAPITAL SERVICES.
     
EXAMINES ISSUES IN THE MONITORING AND CONTROL OF SEAT USE FOR STUDY PURPOSES
IN HIGHER EDUCATION LIBRARIES' REPORTS BRIEFLY ON AN EXPERIMENTAL MONITORING
SYSTEM WHICH ADOPTS A ROTATING SAMPLE SURVEY DESIGN TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON
THIS IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE OF LIBRARY USER BEHAVIOUR, WHICH WITH A HIGH DEGREE
OF INITIAL ORGANISATION HAS BEEN FOUND CAPABLE OF BEING USEFULLY IMPLEMENTED
BY LIBRARY STAFF WITH LITTLE SURVEY TRAINING. THE SURVEY, UNDERTAKEN AT THE
FREWEN LIBRARY, PORTSMOUTH POLYTECHNIC (UK), PRODUCED A GOOD RESPONSE FROM
USERS, WAS SWIFT IN IMPLEMENTATION AND CAUSED LITTLE DISRUPTION OF LIBRARY
ACTIVITY.
