LIBRARIES' ROLE IN INFORMATION ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1945, SERIOUS EFFORTS 1ST BEGAN TO
DISSEMINATE INFORMATION ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE UNITED NATIONS HAS OVER
300 DEPOT LIBRARIES, 14 OF THEM IN SCANDINAVIA. INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AGENCIES EXIST IN ALL 5 SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. IN SOME COUNTRIES INFORMATION
IS AVAILABLE FROM THESE AGENCIES, BUT IN OTHERS ONLY FROM NON-GOVERNMENT
ORGANISATIONS. SPECIAL LIBRARIES EXIST IN SEVERAL SCANDINAVIAN INSTITUTIONS,
RESEARCH BEING PARTICULARLY CONCENTRATED ON AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA.
SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAVE SPECIALISED RESEARCH INSTITUTES. SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION MUST BE SOUGHT IN LARGE GENERAL PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES, AND
FROM LOCAL HUMANITARIAN, POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS ORGANISATIONS. A
PAN-SCANDINAVIAN BIBLIOGRAPHY OF RELEVANT DATA BASES WOULD BE VALUABLE.
LIBRARIANS RECOGNISE A NEED FOR BETTER ORGANISED DOCUMENTATION; LIBRARY
ASSOCIATIONS IN DENMARK, NORWAY AND SWEDEN HAVE ESTABLISH ED COMMITTEES OF
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. SCANDINAVIAN NATIONAL AND REGIONAL COMMITTEES ON THESE
LINES ARE DESIRABLE TO COORDINATE ACCESSIONS AND ESTABLISH AREA AND SUBJECT
SPECIALISATION PLANS.
