THE FUTURE OF SERIALS.
     
THE FUTURE OF SERIALS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPLEX INTER-RELATED
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PRINTING AND PUBLISHING INDUSTRY AND BY THE IMPACT OF
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DOMESTIC AND COMMERCIAL INFORMATION MARKETS. SUGGESTS A
RESEARCH PROJECT INTO THE INFORMATION USE OF PROFESSIONALS IN A VARIETY OF
FIELDS, USING DATA GATHERED BY LIBRARIANS OBSERVING PROFESSIONALS AT WORK. THE
RESULTS COULD FORM AN IDEAL BASIS FOR DISCOVERING THE WAYS IN WHICH
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SHOULD EVOLVE IN KEEPING WITH INFORMATION-SEEKING
PATTERNS. SUCH KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE INVALUABLE FOR ALL THOSE INTERESTED IN THE
FUTURE OF SERIALS.
