THE COMMERCIAL CIRCULATING LIBRARY IN THE 1970S.

THE HOPES PLACED IN THE 'TUPPENNY' LIBRARY IN THE 1930S WERE SEEN TO BE
SHORT-LIVED BY THE 1950S. CIRCULATING LIBRARIES ARE DEFINED AS THOSE FROM
WHICH BOOKS WERE BORROWED THROUGH SUBSCRIPTION OR SMALL FEES PAID TO THE
BUSINESS CONCERNS PROVIDING THEM. THEY WERE PRIMARILY FOR RECREATIONAL
READING, AND AGENTS INCLUDED HARROD'S, BOOTS AND SMALLER SHOPS. STOCK WAS
BOUGHT OR OBTAINED THROUGH SUPPLIERS SUCH AS ALLIED LIBRARIES IN MANCHESTER,
WHO DECLINED IN THAT PART OF THEIR BUSINESS, AND CLOSED IT IN 1975, AND SOUTH
COUNTY LIBRARIES WHO SUPPLIED TO 6,000-7,000 AGENTS AFTER THE WAR, AND TO LESS
THAN 150 IN 1978. SOME AGENTS WERE RELUCTANT TO CLOSE, BECAUSE OF CUSTOMER
RELATIONS, WHILE YOUNGER SHOP OWNERS WERE OFTEN UNINTERESTED.
