ON DEMANDS TO REMODEL LIBRARY CONDITIONS AT THE 5 'OLD' UNIVERSITIES
(TECHNICAL COLLEGES) IN THE STATE OF NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA.

THE 1979/80 LIBRARY GUIDE TO THE AACHEN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FUNCTIONS
SIMULTANEOUSLY AS A CRITIQUE OF CONDITIONS AT THE LIBRARY. AACHEN IS NOW A
UNIVERSITY WITH ALMOST 30,000 STUDENTS BUT THE LIBRARY SYSTEM IS LARGELY
DECENTRALISED WITH MANY SMALL INSTITUTE LIBRARIES. SOME OF THESE HAVE BEEN
REORGANISED AND REHOUSED, BUT MANY STILL NEED TO BE RESTRUCTURED. THERE IS A
LACK OF CENTRALISATION AND COORDINATION WHICH CAN BE FOUND OUT MOST OF THE
'OLD' NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA UNIVERSITIES WHICH ARE NOT PLANNED, CAMPUS
UNIVERSITIES. THERE IS A NEED FOR A COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF LIBRARY STOCK.
LIBRARY GUIDES SUCH AS THE AACHEN EXAMPLE ARE OF GREAT VALUEAND SHOULD BE
PUBLISHED AT ALL THE LIBRARIES. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO INTEGRATE SMALL
INSTITUTE LIBRARIES TO IMPROVE COORDINATION WORK. LIBRARIANS ARE OF THE
OPINION THAT LIBRARIES SHOULD BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUAL CASES AND THAT PLANS
AND LAWS FOR REMODELLING LIBRARY CONDITIONS SHOULD BEWARE OF GENERALISATION.
