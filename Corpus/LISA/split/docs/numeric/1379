QUALITY ISSUES IN RETROSPECTIVE CONVERSION PROJECTS.

LATE IN DEC 79 A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SENT TO 446 MEMBERS OF OCLC, INC., TO
ASCERTAIN THEIR VIEWS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SPECIAL MINIMAL STANDARD TO BE
USED ONLY FOR RETROSPECTIVE CONVERSION PROJECTS. IT WAS FOUND THAT 74.5% WOULD
OPPOSE THE CREATION OF A NEW LOWER STANDARD. DESPITE THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTRA
REQUIREMENTS TO UPGRADE AN EARLIER CATALOGUE RECORD TO MEET CURRENT STANDARDS,
LIBRARIANS, IN GENERAL, SHOWED A STRONG COMMITMENT TOWARD QUALITY AND
COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT STANDARDS.
