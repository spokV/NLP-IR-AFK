FICHE OR FILM FOR COM CATALOGUES-TWO USE TESTS.

THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT
BERKELEY, CARRIED OUT 2 STUDIES IN 1979 IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS UNDERTOOK A
SERIES OF 'CATALOGUE LOOK-UP' QUIZZES, ANSWERING SIMILAR SETS OF QUESTIONS
THROUGH THE USE OF FILM AND FICHE VERSIONS OF THE SAME CATALOGUE. THE 1ST TEST
EMPLOYED AVERAGE LIBRARY USERS-STUDENTS AND THEIR NON-STUDENT ACQUAINTANCES.
THE 2ND TEST FOCUSSED ON CAMPUS LIBRARY STAFF. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE
IS VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE EASE OR DIFFICULTY OF USE OF MICROFILM AND
MICROFICHE AND THAT THE DECISION ON WHICH TO INSTALL SHOULD BE BASED ON
GROUNDS OTHER THAN EASE OF USE.
