CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES: THE LITERACY PLACE.

BASED ON A SPEECH GIVEN AT THE OTTAWA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE, OCT 81.
LIBRARIES IN ONTARIO WERE CONTACTED IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE CHILDREN'S
LITERACY PROJECTS. SPECIAL PROGRAMMES WERE FOUND AT ETOBICOKE, NORTH YORK AND
LONDON. WINDSOR PUBLIC LIBRARY SPECIALISES IN READING TO CHILDREN. SOME
LIBRARIES OFFER PRACTICAL WORKSHOPS; DO THEY HELP LITERACY? AUTHOR SUSAN
GLAZER SPECIFIES 7 LANGUAGE EXERCISES' LISTENING; WRITING; ACTING; PLAYING;
CONSTRUCTING; READING; THINKING. THE LIBRARY SHOULD SUPPLY ALL SITUATIONS
CONDUCIVE TO THESE ACTIVITIES, E.G. STORY HOURS, BOOK MAKING, DRAMA GROUPS,
CRAFTS. OBSERVATION OF THE CHILDREN AND OF THEIR ATTENTION AND PROGRESS, AND
CONTACT WITH PARENTS, ARE ADVISED.
