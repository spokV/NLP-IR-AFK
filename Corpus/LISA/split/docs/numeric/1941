OPTIMUM DESIGN OF TWO-COMPUTER NETWORKS.
     
2 IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IN DESIGNING COMPUTER NETWORKS ARE INVESTIGATED AND
SOLVED FOR 2-COMPUTER NETWORKS' ASSIGNMENT OF PROGRAMME MODULES AND DATA FILES
TO THE DIFFERENT COMPUTERS IN THE NETWORK AND SELECTION OF CAPACITIES IN THE
NETWORK. THE INTERDEPENDENCES OF AN APPLICATION PROGRAMME'S MODULES AND FILES
ARE REPRESENTED, USING A GRAPH MODEL. A BRANCH-AND-BOUND ALGORITHM IS
DEVELOPED TO MINIMISE PROGRAMME EXECUTION TIME. A 2ND, EARLIER-DEVELOPED
ALGORITHM IS USED WITH THE 1ST ALGORITHM TO ALLOCATE A FIXED NUMBER OF DOLLARS
AMONG THE NETWORK'S SUBSYSTEMS SUCH THAT THE PROGRAMME EXECUTION TIME IS AGAIN
MINIMISED. PRESENTS RESULTS OBTAINED BY USING THE ALGORITHMS WITH
EXPERIMENTALLY-MEASURED DATA.
