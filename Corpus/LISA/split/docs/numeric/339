CRITERIA FOR WEEDING BOOKS IN A UNIVERSITY MUSIC LIBRARY.

GUIDELINES ON WEEDING OF BOOKS IN A UNIVERSITY MUSIC LIBRARY, BASED ON
EXPERIENCE AT THE MUSIC LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY,
WHERE A SAMPLE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO DEVELOP QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA FOR
SELECTING BOOKS FOR STORAGE. MEASURABLE INFORMATION OF CIRCULATION RECORDS,
SUBJECT, LANGUAGE AND PUBLICATION DATE WERE USED AND SELECTION WAS MADE ON THE
BASIS OF THESE QUANTITATIVE MEANS TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR THE APPLICATION
OF SUBJECTIVE QUALITATIVE CRITERIA.
