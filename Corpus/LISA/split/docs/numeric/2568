WHEN THE NATIONAL LIBRARIAN AGAIN SPOKE HIS MIND.
     
COMMENTS ON THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DANISH RESEARCH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
(DANMARKS FORSKNINGSBIBLIOTEKSFORENINGS) GIVEN BY PALLE BIRKELUND, THE
NATIONAL LIBRARIAN. DANISH RESEARCH LIBRARIES ARE NOT GIVEN THE SUPPORT FROM
THE STATE IN THE ECONOMIC CRISIS WHICH THEY RECEIVE IN SWEDEN. HE EXPRESSED
FEARS THAT THE PROPOSED LIBRARY ACT, FAR FROM CREATING UNITY WITHIN THE DANISH
LIBRARY SERVICE, WOULD EMPHASISE THE DIVISION BETWEEN RESEARCH LIBRARIES UNDER
THE CULTURAL MINISTRY AND THOSE UNDER THE EDUCATION MINISTRY. HE HOPED THAT
THE CULTURAL MINISTER WOULD NOT BE UNDULY INFLUENCED BY THE DANISH LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION WHEN FORMULATING THE LIBRARY ACT RELATED TO RESEARCH LIBRARIES.
INSTEAD OF ATTACKING THEM FOR LACK OF OPENNESS TO THE PUBLIC THE MINISTER
SHOULD SEE THAT ECONOMIC BARRIERS TO THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE REMOVED.
