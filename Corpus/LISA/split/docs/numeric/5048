THE LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF FORESTRY AND TIMBER INDUSTRY DATES BACK TO
THE 18TH CENTURY. A SCHOOL OF MINING WAS FOUNDED BY KING KARL III IN 1735.
THIS SCHOOL DEVELOPED AND FROM 1770 ALSO TAUGHT FORESTRY SCIENCE. IN 1808 IT
BECAME AN INSTITUTE OF FORESTRY, AND THIS REFLECTED ON THE CONTENTS OF THE
LIBRARY WHICH EXPANDED TO COVER NEW SUBJECT AREAS. THE INSTITUTE BECAME THE
ACADEMY OF MINING AND FORESTRY IN 1846 AND ONLY ACQUIRED UNIVERSITY STATUS IN
1934. THE LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY THE 1ST WORLD WAR,
INADEQUATE BUILDINGS AND LACK OF STAFF. WITH THE FOUNDING OF THE UNIVERSITY A
NEW LIBRARY WAS ALSO PLANNED. THE NEW LIBRARY BUILDING WAS OPENED IN 1977. IT
IS THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND IN HUNGARY, DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO SPECIALIST
LITERATURE CONCERNING FORESTRY AND THE TIMBER INDUSTRY. THE LIBRARY IS
EQUIPPED WITH THE LATEST TECHNICAL FACILITIES AND PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT
SERVICE TO ITS USERS.
