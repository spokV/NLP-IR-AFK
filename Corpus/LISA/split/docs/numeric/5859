ON CHARGING FOR INFORMATION SERVICES.

COMMENTS ON A REPORT BY THE DELEGATION FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION PROVISION' 2INFORMATION AT ANY PRICE' ON CHARGING FOR INFORMATION
SERVICES1, IN WHICH IT IS SUGGESTED THAT INTERLENDING FROM SCIENTIFIC
LIBRARIES SHOULD BE CHARGED AT A STANDARD RATE PER LOAN, DESPITE THE FACT THAT
CHARGING FOR TRADITIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE COMMISSION'S
REMIT. 1 REASON FOR CONSIDERING CHARGES NONETHELESS IS THE INCREASING SCOPE
AND COST OF INTERLENDING. ANOTHER IS THE CHANGE IN THE BUDGETING OF
INSTITUTIONS FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION WHICH HAS TRANSFERRED LIBRARY ALLOCATIONS
FROM THE STATE TO THE INSTITUTIONS; THESE ARE TEMPTED TO ACHIEVE SAVINGS
THROUGH CHARGES ON INTERLENDING. THE REPORT REGARDS INTERLENDING OF LITTLE
IMPORTANCE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO CALCULATE THE COST OF
INTERLENDING, NOR THE COST OF ADMINISTERING A SYSTEM OF CHARGES.
