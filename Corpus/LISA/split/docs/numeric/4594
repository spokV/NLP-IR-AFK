THE USE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN QUEBEC IN RELATION TO CERTAIN INBUILT VARIABLES.
     
REPORT OF A STUDY CARRIED OUT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTREAL IN 1980-81, TO
INVESTIGATE UNDER-USAGE, AND THE EFFECTS OF SUCH ELEMENTS IN THE INTERNAL
SYSTEM OF LIBRARY ORGANISATION AND OPERATION AS THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS
AVAILABLE, STAFFING ARRANGEMENTS, AND HOURS OF OPENING. DATA WERE COLLECTED
FROM A SAMPLE OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF POTENTIAL USERS BY INTERVIEW AND
QUESTIONNAIRE, AND ANALYSED MANUALLY. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF CALCULATIONS TO
ESTABLISH THE RATE OF UNDER-USE, AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EFFECT OF THE
VARIABLES TESTED. FINDINGS SHOWED HOURS OF OPENING TO HAVE THE GREATEST
INFLUENCE ON USE. CONCLUDES THAT ULTIMATELY THE LEVEL OF STAFFING IS CRUCIAL
IN PROMOTING LIBRARY USE, AND RECOMMENDS THAT GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS ON
LIBRARY PERSONNEL TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT.
