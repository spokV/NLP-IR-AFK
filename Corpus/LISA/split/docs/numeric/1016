THE PROGRAMME FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH COMPLETED.

THE LIBRARY HIGH SCHOOL'S WORKING PARTY ON LIBRARY RESEARCH HAS NOW COMPLETED
ITS WORK AND DRAWN UP A PROGRAMME. THE BACKGROUND TO THE WORK WAS THE REFORM
OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN 1977, WHICH ENCOURAGED RESEARCH, GIVING PRIORITY TO'
DEVELOPMENT OF FOUNDATION COURSES WHICH ENCOURAGE THE STUDENTS TO MAKE USE OF
NEW RESEARCH RESULTS, FURTHER TRAINING OF LECTURERS, AND IMPROVEMENT OF
FACILITIES FOR LECTURERS TO FOLLOW CURRENT RESEARCH. THE WORKING PARTY AT ITS
1ST MEETING IN AUG 78 ADOPTED THESE GUIDELINES' TO EXAMINE EXISTING
EDUCATIONAL PLANS TO SEE HOW FAR THEY PROMOTE STUDENT USE OF LIBRARY RESEARCH;
TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH; TO PROMOTE RESEARCH SKILLS
AMONG TEACHERS OF LIBRARIANSHIP; TO INITIATE RESEARCH PROJECTS. A PERMANENT
SEMINAR FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH WAS SET UP IN 1978 AND PARTICIPANTS WERE SENT ON
COURSES AND CONFERENCES. AN EXAMINATION OF ON-GOING LIBRARY-RELEVANT RESEARCH
IN SWEDISH SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS WAS MADE  AND TO FACILITATE THE MONITORING
OF THIS RESEARCH A COMPUTER BASED INDEX' NORDIC BDI INDEX, HAS BEEN CREATED.
IT REMAINS TO PLAN A COURSE BRIDGING THE TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS AND
RESEARCHERS IN THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION FIELD.
