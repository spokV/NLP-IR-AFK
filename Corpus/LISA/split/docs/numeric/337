INTERLIBRARY LOAN COST STUDY AND COMPARISON.

DETAILS HOW MUCH A MANUAL, NON-AUTOMATED ADAPTATION OF VERNON E. PALMOUR'S
STUDY ON INTERLIBRARY LOAN COSTS, CHARACTERISTICS, AND MAGNITUDE WAS DESIGNED
AND IMPLEMENTED TO SHOW ILL COSTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA. IT IS HOPED
THAT OTHER NON-AUTOMATED INSTITUTIONS COULD USE THE OU METHODOLOGY AS A POINT
OF DEPARTURE FOR COST STUDIES OF THEIR OWN. RESULTS OF THE OU STUDY ARE
COMPARED WITH THE PALMOUR STUDY, WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN 1972. THE COST OF A
BORROWING TRANSACTION WAS $4.98 OU, $7.61 PALMOUR. A FILLED LENDING
TRANSACTION COST $5.45 OU, $4.67 PALMOUR, AN UNFILLED LENDING TRANSACTION COST
$5.40 OU, $2.12 PALMOUR.
