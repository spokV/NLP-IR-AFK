LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE HANDICAPPED.
     
DESCRIBES LIBRARY SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE HANDICAPPED IN EUROPE, THE U.S.A.,
AND CANADA, EXCLUDING QUEBEC. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND,
LEGISLATION, AND NOTABLE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE VENTURES. THE DISCUSSION IS
DIVIDED INTO SECTIONS, DEALING RESPECTIVELY WITH HOSPITAL SERVICES,
DOMICILIARY SERVICES, AND SERVICES FOR THE VISUALLY HANDICAPPED, THE MENTALLY
HANDICAPPED, AND THE DEAF. THE SURVEY LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE
MENTALLY HANDICAPPED AND THE DEAF ARE THE MOST NEGLECTED GROUPS. THE
IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY INITIATIVES, ESPECIALLY IN THE U.S.A. AND CANADA,
IS EMPHASISED, IN RELATION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES IN QUEBEC, WHERE
LIBRARIANS ARE NOT PREPARED TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED.
