USER EDUCATION FOR AN ONLINE CATALOG' A WORKSHOP APPROACH.

FOR MORE THAN 6 YEARS, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES HAVE HAD PUBLIC
TERMINALS AVAILABLE FOR SEARCHING THEIR LIBRARY CONTROL SYSTEM (LCS), A FORMER
CIRCULATION SYSTEM THAT IS EVOLVING INTO AN ON-LINE CATALOGUE. PATRON
INSTRUCTION IN USE OF THE SYSTEM HAS EXPANDED IN PARALLEL WITH THE EVOLUTION
OF LCS, MOVING FROM INFORMAL PRINTED INSTRUCTIONS TO A STANDARDISED 1 HOUR
WORKSHOP. A YEAR OF EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THE WORKSHOP TO BE A VALUABLE PART OF
THE LIBRARIES' USER-EDUCATION PROGRAMME AND A PARTICULARLY SUITABLE APPROACH
FOR ON-LINE CATALOGUE INSTRUCTION.
