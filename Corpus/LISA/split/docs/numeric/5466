CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN ENGLISH' A SELECT, ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY, 1835-1935.

SINCE THE 1950S THE STUDY OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED INTO AN
AUTONOMOUS ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE. RESEARCH INSTITUTES AND INFORMATION CENTRES AS
WELL AS SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS IN THE FIELD HAVE PROLIFERATED. SEVERAL
SCHOLARLY PERIODICALS ARE DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. CURRENT
ACADEMIC INTEREST IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE GROWING
NUMBER OF DISSERTATIONS AND THESES FOR ADVANCED DEGREES. THIS TENDENCY IS ALSO
DISCERNABLE IN SOUTH AFRICA. AN INFORMATION CENTRE FOR CHILDREN'S LITERATURE
AND MEDIA (ISKEMUS) WAS ESTABLISHED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF STELLENBOSCH IN 1978.
POTCHEFSTROOM HAS AN INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE WHICH HAS
ALREADY HELD 2 COUNTRY-WIDE SYMPOSIA AND HAS HAD A BOOK PUBLISHED UNDER ITS
AUSPICES BY TAFELBERG. ACADEMIC STUDY OF THE GENRE NECESSITATES THE FORMATION
OF COLLECTIONS OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS AND MEDIA REFLECTING THE PERSONAL BIAS AN D
INTEREST OF THE RESEARCHERS. SUCH COLLECTION BUILDING HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY
DIFFICULT BECAUSE INVESTORS REGARD FINE CHILDREN'S BOOKS AS SOUND FINANCIAL
INVESTMENTS BECAUSE OF THEIR SCARCITY. AT STELLENBOSCH A PRIVATE COLLECTION OF
ABOUT 1,000 BOOKS REFLECTS THE CULTURAL INFLUENCE OF MAINLY VICTORIAN ENGLISH
MIDDLE-CLASS JUVENILE READING MATTER, 1830-1930. A VERY BRIEF INDICATION OF
SOME OF THE INTERESTING ITEMS IS REFLECTED IN THE SELECT, ANNOTATED ABSTRACT
OF THE CATALOGUE OF HISTORICAL BOOKS.
