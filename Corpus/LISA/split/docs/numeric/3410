THE EURONET TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK-ITS FUTURE ROLE?.
     
THE EURONET TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK IS A PACKET BASED DATA NETWORK
INITIALLY PROVIDED TO ENABLE LOW COST ACCESS TO BE OBTAINED TO SCIENTIFIC,
TECHNICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC DATA BASES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC
COMMUNITY. IT HAS HOWEVER SERVED AS A MEANS TO STANDARDISE DATA COMMUNICATIONS
PROTOCOLS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY AND HAS PROVIDED A STIMULUS FOR
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ADMINISTRATIONS TO ESTABLISH NOT ONLY NATIONAL NETWORKS
WHICH WHEN INTERCONNECTED WILL ENABLE THE INITIAL EURONET NETWORK TO BE
ABSORBED, BUT ALSO NEW SERVICES CAPABLE OF UTILISING PACKET SWITCHED NETWORKS.
THE PLANNED AVAILABILITY OF THESE NETWORKS ON A EUROPEAN SCALE IS NOW
PROVIDING A STIMULUS TO MANUFACTURERS OF DATA TERMINALS TO MAKE AVAILABLE NEW
RANGES OF EQUIPMENT CAPABLE OF EXPLOITING THE SPECIAL FACILITIES OFFERED BY A
PACKET BASED NETWORK FOR MESSAGE TRANSMISSION AND EURONET COULD PROVIDE A
TESTBED TO ASSIST IN THIS DEVELOPMENT.
