TEN YEARS OF ISDS.
     
IN 1967 ICSU SET UP UNISIST TO EXAMINE POSSIBLE WAYS OF CREATING A WORLDWIDE
INFORMATION SYSTEM. ISDS WAS SET UP AS A PART OF UNISIST IN 1971 WITH THE
INTERNATIONAL CENTRE IN PARIS. THE 1ST NATIONAL CENTRE WAS SET UP IN THE USA.
THE NATIONAL CENTRES NOW NUMBER 45. THE FINNISH CENTRE STARTED IN 1975. MEMBER
COUNTRIES PAY A FEE. FINLAND'S ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION IS ABOUT 19,000 MARKS. ISDS
CENTRE ALSO EARNS MONEY BY SELLING PUBLICATIONS. ISDS CENTRE COORDINATES THE
WORK OF THE NATIONAL CENTRES. IT PUBLISHES ISDS REGISTER AND BULLETIN. IN 1981
THE REGISTER CONTAINED ABOUT 120,000 ITEMS. THE CENTRE COOPERATES WITH OTHER
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS. THE NATIONAL CENTRES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
CATALOGUING SERIALS FOR ISDS AND MAINTAINING DATA BASES FOR NATIONAL SERIAL
PUBLICATIONS. THERE ARE ALSO SOME AREA CENTRES, E.G. IN MOSCOW, WHICH COVERS
THE USSR, HUNGARY, BULGARIA, EAST GERMANY, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, CUBA, AND MONGOLIA.
THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE CATALOGUES BY ISDS MANUAL, WHICH DIFFE RS FROM
ISBD(S). FINNISH MATERIALS ARE CATALOGUED BY ISBD(S). DIFFICULTIES IN
COMBINING THE 2 SIMILAR DESCRIPTIONS OF SERIALS ARE DISCUSSED.
