CORRELATES OF COMMUNICATION BEHAVIOR IN THE RESEARCH LABORATORY.
     
(PHD THESIS-UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN.) EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
THE SELECTION POTENTIAL OF AN INDIVIDUAL AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION, AND THE
'NUCLEAR' ENVIRONMENT OF THAT INDIVIDUAL. THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY IS LIMITED TO
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION COMMUNICATED BETWEEN RESEARCH
SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCH ENGINEERS IN AN R&D LABORATORY SETTING. RESULTS
SUPPORT THE PREMISE THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A
SCIENTIST'S 'NUCLEAR' ENVIRONMENT AND HIS SELECTION POTENTIAL AS A SOURCE OF
STI. A MULTIVARIATE MODEL IS DESIGNED FOR USE IN EVALUATING FORMAL AND
INFORMAL COMMUNICATION NETWORKS IN THE ORGANISATION.
