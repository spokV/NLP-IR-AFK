TURKISH LIBRARY DEVELOPMENTS.
     
THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF LIBRARY SCIENCE CAME TO BE GRADUALLY APPRECIATED IN
TURKEY ONLY IN THE 1940S WHEN ADNAN OTUKEN RETURNED FROM LIBRARY SCIENCE
STUDIES IN GERMANY. DETERMINED TO MAKE LIBRARIANSHIP A RECOGNISED PROFESSION,
HE CAMPAIGNED FOR A NATIONAL LIBRARY (ESTABLISHED IN 1946), TAUGHT LIBRARY
SCIENCE (BASIS OF DEPARTMENT OF LIBRARY SCIENCE AT ANKARA UNIVERSITY), AND
HELPED FOUND THE TURKISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IN 1949. PUBLIC AND CHILDREN'S
LIBRARIES HAVE INCREASED IN NUMBERS IN THE LAST DECADE (244 TO 700 AND 174 TO
400). THEIR PROBLEMS INCLUDE LACK OF TRAINED STAFF AND THE 180,000 MANUSCRIPTS
AND RARE BOOKS IN THEIR CARE. UNIVERSITY LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN UNEVEN
AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE MOST NEGLECTED. TURDOK (NATIONAL DOCUMENTATION CENTRE
FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY) WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1966. LIBRARY EDUCATION
PROGRAMMES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED.
