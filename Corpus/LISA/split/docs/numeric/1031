LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND LIBRARY EDUCATION' A CONTINUING PROBLEM.

IT IS OFTEN SUPRISING TO ENQUIRERS TO LEARN THAT THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF
SINGAPORE (LAS) HAS SO MANY QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS AND YET SINGAPORE HAS NO
LIBRARY SCHOOL. LIBRARY EDUCATION HAS BEEN A PERPLEXING PROBLEM THROUGH THE 25
YEARS OF EXISTENCE OF THE LAS. DISCUSSES THE NEED FOR A LIBRARY SCHOOL IN
SINGAPORE, AND TRACES THE HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBRARY EDUCATION THROUGH
THE WORK OF THE PERSATUAN PERPUSTAKAAN MALAYSIA, AND THE LAS, RENAMED IN 1966
AS PERSATUAN PERPUSTAKAAN SINGAPURA. LOOKS FORWARD TO THE TIME WHEN THE
QUESTION OF FORMAL LIBRARY EDUCATION WOULD BE REVIEWED MORE REGULARLY BY
LIBRARY AUTHORITIES.
