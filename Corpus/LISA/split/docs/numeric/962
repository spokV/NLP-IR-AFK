POSITIVE RESULTS OF COORDINATION.

REGULATIONS ON BIBLIOGRAPHY COORDINATION IN SLOVAKIA ISSUED 2 YEARS AGO
STIPULATE 3 CATEGORIES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC CENTRES INTERLINKED BOTH VERTICALLY
AND HORIZONTALLY TO BRING ABOUT A COMPREHENSIVE NETWORK, IN WHICH EVEN
REGIONAL NEEDS AND DEMANDS ARE CATERED FOR. THE SCIENTIFIC STATE LIBRARY IN
BANSKA BYSTRICA HAS THE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO COORDINATE
BIBLIOGRAPHIES COVERING THE ANTIFASCIST RESISTANCE MOVEMENT DURING WORLD WAR
II AND THE SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING IN 1944. DURING THE YEARS 1979-80, THE
TOTAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC OUTPUT IN THIS FIELD WAS 6,400 COPIES OF 39 HEADINGS, WITH
A TOTAL OF 4,311 PAGES AND 11,142 ANNOTATIONS. THE NEXT MAJOR TASK CONFRONTING
THE LIBRARY STAFF IS THE COMPILATION OF A CRITICAL COMPREHENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY
ON THE AFORESAID TOPICS. A PLAN OF FUTURE PUBLICATIONS HAS ALSO TO BE WORKED
OUT IN DETAIL.
