LIBRARY MEDIA CENTRES. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO 718 LIBRARIANS AND 478
USABLE RETURNS WERE COLLECTED. LIBRARIANS SEEM, IN THEIR SELECTION, TO AVOID
CONTROVERSIAL TITLES; THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ABSENCE OF CONTROVERSIAL
TITLES FROM THE LIBRARIANS' COLLECTIONS WAS NOT UNIFORMLY A SIGNAL FOR THE
ORDERING OF TITLES; AND THE PRESENCE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF RESTRICTED ACCESS
MATERIALS AGAIN INDICATES LIBRARIANS' RELUCTANCE TO FACE CENSORSHIP BATTLES.
