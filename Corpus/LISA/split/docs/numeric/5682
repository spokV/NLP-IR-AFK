REGIONAL COLLABORATION IN THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SYSTEM.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN.
SWEDEN'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE BASICALLY OPERATED BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THE
STATE CAN PROVIDE GRANTS TO LEVEL OUT STANDARDS BUT DOES NOT INTERFERE IN THE
RUNNING OF LOCAL LIBRARIES, AND SWEDEN HAS NO LIBRARIES ACT. MUNICIPAL
AUTHORITIES THEMSELVES DECIDE THE OBJECTIVES, SCALE AND STRUCTURE OF THEIR
LIBRARY SERVICES. ALL OF SWEDEN'S 279 MUNICIPALITIES PROVIDE MUNICIPAL LIBRARY
SERVICES. CERTAIN LIBRARY FUNCTIONS WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE ON A
PURELY MUNICIPAL BASIS-IT IS THEREFORE RATIONAL AND EFFICIENT TO TRANSFER
THESE TO THE REGIONAL OR SUPRAMUNICIPAL-THAT IS, COUNTY-LEVEL.
