SKAMOKOWA STORY' RURAL LIBRARY SERVICE IN WASHINGTON STATE.

SKAMOKAWA, A VILLAGE OF 250 POPULATION, IN WASHINGTON'S 2ND SMALLEST COUNTY,
WAHKIAKUM, HAS, IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, GAINED A LIBRARY. THE NUCLEUS OF THE
COLLECTION CAME FROM THE LOCAL SCHOOL, BUT THE LIBRARY NOW BOASTS A BOOK
COLLECTION, PAPERBACKS, INTERLIBRARY LOAN SERVICES, A FILM BORROWING SERVICE,
AND A REFERENCE SERVICE. VOLUNTEERS PROVIDE REMEDIAL READING, TUTORING, AND
INSTRUCTION IN FRENCH. THE LIBRARY IS DEPENDENT ON DONATED FUNDS, AND
FUND-RAISING IS AN EVER PRESENT CHORE. VOLUNTEER HELP IS ERRATIC AND LACK OF
TIME HAS PREVENTED THE LIBRARIAN FROM CATALOGUING THE COLLECTION. THE LIBRARY
SUCCEEDS, ULTIMATELY, THROUGH COMMUNITY DETERMINATION, AND, OPERATING ON THE
PREMISE THAT SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING, CARES FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BY
PROVIDING WHAT IS REALLY WANTED BY THE POPULATION IT SERVES.
