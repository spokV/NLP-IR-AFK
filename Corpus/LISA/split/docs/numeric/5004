INFORMATION BANKS, DATA BANKS, AND DATA BASES' AN ATTEMPT AT CLARIFICATION OF
TERMS.

A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1980 CANADIAN CONFERENCE WHICH DERIVES A STRUCTURAL
TYPOLOGY FOR INFORMATION BANKS FROM THE PRELIMINARY CONSTRUCTION OF TYPOLOGIES
OF DOCUMENTARY INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTARY ELEMENTS. THE 1ST TYPOLOGY DEVELOPS
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTARY INFORMATION; THE 2ND
LEADS TO REDEFINITION OF THE CONCEPTS OF RECORDS, DOCUMENTS, AND
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ENTRIES. THE CREATION OF THE INFORMATION BANK TYPOLOGY LEADS
TO EXPLANATION OF THE DATA BASE CONCEPT, AND IN CONCLUSION A DEFINITION OF
DOCUMENTATION IS ADVANCED. THE ARGUMENT IS ILLUSTRATED BY REFERENCE TO
CANADIAN EXAMPLES.
