FUNCTIONAL INFORMATION DESIGN' RESEARCH AND PRACTICE.
     
ALTHOUGH FUNCTIONAL OBJECTIVES HAVE CONCERNED DESIGNERS FOR MANY YEARS, AND
PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE PUBLISHED RESEARCH ON ISSUES RELATED TO GRAPHIC DESIGN,
FRUITFUL COOPERATION BETWEEN THE 2 SPECIALISMS HAS ONLY RARELY BEEN ACHIEVED.
SUGGESTS THAT THE TRADITIONAL OBJECTIVES AND METHODS OF NEITHER GROUP ARE
SUFFICIENTLY ORIENTED TOWARDS THE COMMUNICATION OF INFORMATION IN A COMPLEX
SOCIETY. A USER-CENTRED APPROACH IS URGED, DRAWING FROM BOTH THE INTUITIVE
PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS OF DESIGNERS AND THE METHODOLOGIES OF PSYCHOLOGISTS.
