REFERENCE MATERIALS IN A TELEPHONE REFERENCE SERVICE' A MODEL FOR
TELEREFERENCE.
     
PRESENTS A DESCRIPTION OF A TELEPHONE REFERENCE SERVICE AND THE REFERENCE
MATERIALS USED IN ANSWERING PATRONS' QUERIES. THE DISCUSSION FOCUSES ON THE
APPLICATION OF THE EXPERIENCE OF TELEPHONE REFERENCE LIBRARIANS TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS SUCH AS TELEREFERENCE. IT IS SUGGESTED
THAT SELECTION OF INFORMATION SOURCES TO INCLUDE DATA BASES WOULD BE
FACILITATED BY AN EXAMINATION OF REFERENCE MATERIALS CURRENTLY USED IN
READY-REFERENCE SERVICES.
