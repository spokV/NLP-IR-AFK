MEDICAL LIBRARIES' CHANGES BETWEEN 1970-1978 AND CONDITIONS IN 1979.
     
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF HUNGARIAN SPECIAL LIBRARIES INCLUDING THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1970, 1974, AND 1978. FROM
THE AVERAGE OF 100 SPECIAL LIBRARIES 13 WERE MEDICAL LIBRARIES. HOLDINGS IN
THE ANALYSED SPECIAL LIBRARIES AMOUNTED TO 28.5 MILLION VOLUMES IN 1970, TO
43.6 MILLION IN 1974, AND TO 51.5 MILLION VOLUMES IN 1978. INCREASES 1970-74
AMOUNTED TO 15 MILLION VOLUMES WHILE ACQUISITIONS DECREASED TO 8 MILLION
VOLUMES 1974-78. COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATA REVEALED THAT DURING THE EARLY 70S
HOLDINGS IN LOCAL, INSTITUTIONAL, LIBRARIES HAD BEEN AUGMENTED TO A LARGER
EXTENT THAN IN THE 2ND HALF OF THE DECADE. THE SAME TREND WAS VALID FOR THE 13
MEDICAL LIBRARIES.
