GERMAN ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING RULES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND FOR ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES.
     
AT THE MEETINGS IN MAY AND JUNE 81 THE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEKSINSTITUT (GERMAN
LIBRARY INSTITUTE) COMMITTEE ON ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING WAS CONCERNED WITH
THE DRAFT VERSION OF RAK-OB. LARGE PUBLIC LIBRARIES TEND TO ACCEPT THIS IF
THEY HAVE NOT ALREADY OPTED FOR THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY VERSION BUT SMALLER
PUBLIC LIBRARIES STOCKING MAINLY GERMAN LANGUAGE MATERIAL ARE CRITICAL OF THE
DRAFT. IT WAS DECIDED, THEREFORE, THAT ALTERNATIVES FOR SMALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES
BE INCLUDED IN RAK-OB WITH REFERENCE TO PERSONAL NAMES, CORPORATE BODIES, UNIT
SUBJECT HEADINGS, PARALLEL HEADINGS, SUBORDINATE ENTRIES, ENTRIES FOR
MUSICALIA AND SOUND RECORDINGS FOR CHILDREN. RAK-OB AND RAK-WB MUST NOT DIFFER
ON BASIC PRINCIPLES BUT ARE TO BE KEPT PHYSICALLY SEPARATE. RAK-OB'S 2ND DRAFT
PLAN WILL BE PUBLISHED SOON.
