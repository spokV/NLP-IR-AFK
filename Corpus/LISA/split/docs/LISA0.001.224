STATISTICAL INDICES SYSTEMS AS A BASIS FOR EVALUATION OF THE WORK OF
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION CENTRES.

2 SYSTEMS OF STATISTICAL INDICES FOR EVALUATION OF INFORMATION WORK ARE
PRESENTED: SYSTEM OF PRIMARY INDICES FOR QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF INDIVIDUAL
INFORMATION TASKS; AND SYSTEM OF 'RELATIVE' INDICES WHICH EXPRESS THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL PARAMETERS AND WHICH CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INFORMATION SERVICES AND TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF WORK
UNDERTAKEN BY INFORMATION WORKERS; THE SYSTEM CAN BE USED TO CARRY OUT
COMPARATIVE ANALYSES OF THE ACTIVITIES OF INFORMATION CENTRES. USING THESE 2
SYSTEMS, A COMPLEX METHOD FOR EVALUATION OF THE WORK OF BRANCH INFORMATION
CENTRES WAS DEVELOPED. THE METHOD EMPLOYS AN ALGORITHM DESIGNED BY THE
COMPUTING CENTRE OF THE SIBERIAN BRANCH OF THE USSR ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. THE
METHOD WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE WORK OF 33 BRANCH INFORMATION CENTRES; RESULTS
OF THE EVALUATION ARE PRESENTED.
