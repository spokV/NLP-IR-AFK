LIBRARY AUTOMATION SYSTEMS) IS AN ANCILLARY ENTERPRISE OF THE UNIVERSITY WITH
A COMPLETELY SEPARATE BUDGET AND HAS BEEN SUPPLYING COMPUTER SERVICES TO
CANADIAN LIBRARIES SINCE 1973. THESE SERVICES CENTRED ON CATALOGUE SUPPORT

ADVANTAGE OF ITS 10-MILLION ITEM DATA BASE. PUBLISHERS ARE SEEN AS A PART OF
THE EVENTUAL UTLAS NETWORK.
