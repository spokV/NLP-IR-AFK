LIBRARIES IN A SOCIETY OF PICTORIAL ABUNDANCE' DO THEY HONOUR THEIR
RESPONSIBILITY?.
     
PAPER GIVEN AT THE SWEDISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL MEETING. DESCRIBES
TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE VIDEO FIELD, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO LEAD TO AN
ABUNDANCE OF PICTURES COMPETING ON OUR TV SCREENS. THIS SITUATION HAS BOTH
PROBLEMS AND POSSIBILITIES. THE OUTPUT OF VIDEO CASSETTES CONSISTS MAINLY OF
LOW QUALITY ACTION FILMS AND THE DELAY IN THE PLANS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF
SWEDISH TV PROGRAMMES, WHICH SHOULD HEIGHTEN THE QUALITY, IS REGRETTABLE. BUT
THE NEW DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ALSO OFFERS NEW FREEDOM OF CHOICE AND INDEPENDENCE
OF TRANSMISSION TIMES. VIDEO TECHNIQUES ARE USEFUL FOR MINORITIES SUCH AS THE
DEAF AND IMMIGRANTS. THE VIDEOGRAM COMMISSION THEREFORE RECOMMENDS THAT
LIBRARIES SHOULD SHOW VIDEO FILMS, LEND THEM AND TRANSMIT THEM VIA CABLE.
