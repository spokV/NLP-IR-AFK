ON WHAT BASIS HAVE YOU ORGANISED THIS LIBRARY SINCE ONE CANNOT FIND ANYTHING
IN HERE? (A SURVEY OF USERS: INFORMATION NEEDS).

ASU-RYHMA, A PILOT WORKING GROUP ON A FINNISH SUBJECT HEADING LIST CARRIED OUT
A SURVEY IN OVER 30 PUBLIC LIBRARIES ABOUT THE NATURE OF ENQUIRIES IN 1 MONTH.
4,600 ENQUIRIES WERE LISTED. THIS FIGURE INCLUDES ENQUIRIES OVER A LONGER
PERIOD IN SOME OF THE LIBRARIES. A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE ENQUIRIES CONCERNED
NON-FICTION. THE MOST POPULAR SUBJECT AREAS WERE LITERATURE, LAW, MUSIC AND
HANDICRAFTS. ON PAGES 114 AND 115 THE TYPES OF ENQUIRIES ARE LISTED BY BROAD
CLASSIFICATION. A FINNISH SUBJECT HEADING LIST IS NEEDED URGENTLY BECAUSE OF
THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF MANY OF THE ENQUIRIES FOR WHICH THE CLASSIFICATION
SCHEME USED IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES CANNOT CATER.
