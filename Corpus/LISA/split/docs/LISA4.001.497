THE DELIVERY OF CONTINUING EDUCATION' TELECONFERENCING, AN ALTERNATIVE MODE.
     
AN EXPERIMENTAL OFFERING OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S CONTINUING
EDUCATION COURSE CE 46, LIBRARY MANAGEMENT/BUDGETING WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO 16
HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIANS VIA THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-EDUCATION TELEPHONE
NETWORK. FEATURES OF THE HARDWARE OF THE TELECONFERENCE NETWORK, A FEW
APPLICATIONS RELATING TO MEDICINE AND LIBRARY SCIENCE, AND ADMINISTRATIVE
CONSIDERATIONS ARE EXAMINED. DESCRIBES HOW THE EXPERIMENTAL COURSE WAS
CONDUCTED, COURSE PARTICIPANTS, DESIGN, PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED, AND EVALUATION
DATA OBTAINED FROM PARTICIPANTS. A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TELECONFERENCING
MODE OF DELIVERY AND THE TRADITIONAL FACE-TO-FACE FORMAT IS STRESSED.
RECOMMENDATIONS CALL FOR CONTINUED CONSIDERATION OF TELECONFERENCING AS A
METHOD OF DELIVERING CONTINUING EDUCATION COURSES AND SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY
OF MLA PROVIDING ITS OWN TELECONFERENCING NETWORK.
