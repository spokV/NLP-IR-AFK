EVALUATING UNDERGRADUATE LIBRARY INSTRUCTION AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY.
     
AS A LARGE-SCALE LIBRARY INSTRUCTION PROGRAMME (LIP) WAS IMPLEMENTED AT OHIO
STATE UNIVERSITY, IT WAS EVALUATED AT EACH STAGE BY MEANS OF QUESTIONNAIRES.
DATA DERIVED FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRES HELPED CHANGE THE CONTENT OF THE LIP
LECTURES, THE TYPE OF MATERIALS DISTRIBUTED TO THE STUDENTS, AND THE FORMAT OF
THE EXERCISES. IT ALSO EVALUATED THE SUCCESS THE PROGRAMME HAD IN REACHING
INCOMING STUDENTS AND IN GIVING THEM EXPERIENCE IN USING LIBRARY TOOLS.
SEPARATE SURVEYS ALSO SHOWED THAT STUDENTS RETAINED THEIR SKILLS AFTER A
PERIOD OF TIME, IMPROVED THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE LIBRARY, AND INCREASED
THEIR USE OF LIBRARY RESOURCES.
