AN UNUSUAL SUBJECT LIBRARY.
     
DESCRIBES A BIOLOGY LIBRARY FOR SENIOR PUPILS IN A GRAMMAR SCHOOL. THE LIBRARY
IS OPEN ALL MORNING; PUPILS MAY COME IN FREELY TO STUDY, BORROW BOOKS AND
PHOTOCOPIES AND EXAMINE SPECIMENS. THEY CAN MAKE COFFEE THERE AND CHAT TO
THEIR FRIENDS. ALTHOUGH THE PUPILS THEMSELVES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ISSUES, VERY
FEW BOOKS HAVE BEEN LOST. THERE ARE ABOUT 500 BOOKS, INCLUDING REFERENCE BOOKS
AND TEXTBOOKS, FREQUENTLY WITH MULTIPLE COPIES. IN 1979-80, 150 SENIOR PUPILS
BORROWED, ON AVERAGE, 4 BOOKS EACH. GENERAL SCHOOL LIBRARIES SHOULD BE DIVIDED
INTO SUBJECT LIBRARIES RUN BY DEPARTMENTAL HEADS. THESE LIBRARIES SHOULD BE
SMALL, CLEARLY ARRANGED AND FREELY ACCESSIBLE.
