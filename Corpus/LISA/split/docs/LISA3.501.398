TOPOLOGICAL CENTRIC CODING AND NOMENCLATURE OF POLYCYCLIC HYDROCARBONS. 1.
CONDENSED BENZENOID SYSTEMS (POLYHEXES, FUSENES).
     
ON THE BASIS OF THE FOCAL NUMBERING OF EACH BENZENOID RING IN THE GRAPHITE
LATTICE, ANY POLYHEX (CATA-, PERI, AND CORONA-FUSED POLYCYCLIC BENZENOID
SYSTEM) CAN BE CODED BY MAKING USE OF (1) THE DUALIST GRAPH OF THE POLYHEX AND
(2) THE RECENT GENERALISATION OF THE TOPOLOGICAL CENTRE CONCEPT. THE NUMERICAL
CODE CAN BE USED FOR NOMENCLATURE PURPOSES, AND THE PRESENT APPROACH CAN BE
EASILY GENERALISED TO CONDENSED NONBENZENOID SYSTEMS AS WILL BE SHOWN IN
FUTURE PUBLICATIONS.
