WALTER HOFMANN'S AND RUDOLF ANGERMANN'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
METHODS OF READER RESEARCH. PART 2.
     
WALTER HOFMANN PUBLISHED AS PART 2 OF A PAPER ON LIBRARIES 2ON THE PSYCHOLOGY
OF THE PROLETARIAT (ZUR PSYCHOLOGIE DAS PROLETARIATS) 1IN 1910. HE CARRIED OUT
A GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH INTO THE TYPES OF LITERATURE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE
READ, WHAT CATEGORIES WORKING CLASS READERS COULD BE DIVIDED INTO AND HOW TO
INFLUENCE AND IMPROVE THEIR READING HABITS. HE ALSO CARRIED OUT AN IMPORTANT
SURVEY ON WOMEN'S READING. RUDOLF ANGERMANN CONTINUED AND EXPANDED HOFMANN'S
WORK. THEY BOTH CONSIDERED THE STIMULI TO READ CERTAIN TYPES OF LITERATURE TO
BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AND ANGERMANN FORMULATED A LIST OF DIFFERENT READING
STIMULI. THEY WERE BOTH OF THE OPINION THAT THE LIBRARIAN'S TASK WAS TO ACT AS
ADVISER AND INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE LITERATURE AND THE READER. THEIR AIM WAS
TO OFFER GOOD QUALITY LITERATURE TO LARGE SECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE. TODAY
METHODS OF READER RESEARCH CONTINUE TO BE D EVELOPED IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES
AND AIM TO ACHIEVE AN OPTIMAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ACQUISITION AND USE OF
LITERATURE.
