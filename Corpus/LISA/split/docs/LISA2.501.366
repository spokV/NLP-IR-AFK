MACHINE-READABLE FORM. REVIEWS THE CURRENT STATUS OF MRDFS; DISCUSSES BASIC
CONDITIONS FOR CATALOGUING MRDFS; EXPLAINS HOW A COMPUTER IS OPERATED AND HOW
MRDFS ARE PRODUCED; AND REVIEWS CHAPTER 9 OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING
RULES (2ND EDITION) WHICH IS DEVOTED TO DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUING RULES FOR
MRDFS, FOCUSING ON TROUBLESOME AREAS.
