DORMANT EXCHANGES SUPPORTED BY A SYSTEM OF TOKENS; A SUGGESTION.

THE TERM 'DORMANT EXCHANGE' DESCRIBES AN EXCHANGE SYSTEM IN WHICH 1 LIBRARY
NEEDS AND OBTAINS AN ITEM AT A GIVEN TIME FROM ANOTHER LIBRARY BUT NOT VICE
VERSA. AN EXCHANGE IS STILL MADE, HOWEVER, BUT ON A CREDIT SYSTEM SO THAT THE
OTHER LIBRARY CAN REQUEST DESIRED MATERIAL AT A LATER DATE WHEN THE NEED
ARISES, THUS ELIMINATING WASTEFUL EXCHANGES. THE OPERATION COULD BE GREATLY
SIMPLIFIED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF AN INTERNATIONALLY VALID EXCHANGE TOKEN
ENABLING A RECIPIENT LIBRARY TO PAY FOR EXCHANGE MATERIAL AND A PROVIDING
LIBRARY TO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR WHAT IS SUPPLIED. IT IS CONCEDED THAT VALUATION
OF TOKENS COULD BE PROBLEMATIC.
