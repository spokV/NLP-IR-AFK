LIBRARIES AND THE TWO CULTURES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. CULTURE MAY MEAN AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE BEST THAT HAS
BEEN KNOWN AND SAID IN THE WORLD, AND THE WHOLE CONGERIES OF WAYS IN WHICH A
PARTICULAR PEOPLE CONSTRUCT BUILDINGS, MANUFACTURE ARTIFACTS, WORSHIP DEITIES,
MAKE WAR AND LOVE, RAISE CHILDREN, AND LIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER. TRACES THE
HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND THE 2 CULTURES, CONTENDING THAT
THE MAKEUP OF SOCIETIES AND CULTURES THAT ARE THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD IS NOT
MUCH INFLUENCED BY THE SMALL NUMBER WHO SEEK CULTURE, AND LIBRARIES REMAIN
PERIPHERAL IN THE CULTURE OF THE PEOPLE AS A WHOLE.
