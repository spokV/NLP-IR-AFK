GAMES IN THE LIBRARY.

GAMES CAN PROMOTE SOCIAL CONTACT AND DEVELOP POWERS OF THINKING AND
CONCENTRATION. A MINIMUM STOCK OF 20-50 GAMES IS RECOMMENDED, INCLUDING GAMES
FOR GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS, LOGIC AND WORD GAMES AND GAMES ENCOURAGING
LEARNING AND QUICK THINKING. THEY CAN BE ARRANGED FLAT ON SHELVES OR PLACED ON
TABLES. ADVICE ON PROCESSING AND CATALOGUING IS INCLUDED. EACH GAME SHOULD BE
CHECKED THOROUGHLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER LOAN; MANUFACTURERS WILL USUALLY SUPPLY
SPARE PARTS IF A GAME IS STILL IN PRODUCTION. THE PRESENCE OF GAMES IN THE
LIBRARY SHOULD BE WIDELY ADVERTISED BY PUBLICITY LEAFLETS, NOTICES IN THE
PRESS AND, SINCE CHILDREN ARE THE MAIN GAMES USERS, BY CONTACT WITH YOUTH
GROUPS AND KINDERGARTENS. ORGANISATION BY THE LIBRARY OF REGULAR GAMES
AFTERNOONS OFTEN PROVES POPULAR.
