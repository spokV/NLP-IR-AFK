THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS REFERENCE CORRESPONDENCE REFERRAL PROGRAM.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE REFERENCE AND ADULT SERVICES DIVISION COOPERATIVE
REFERENCE SERVICE COMMITTEE PROGRAMME AT THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
ANNUAL CONFERENCE, SAN FRANCISCO, 29 JUNE 81. DESCRIBES THE SETTING UP OF A
COOPERATIVE REFERRAL SYSTEM TO ANSWER WRITTEN REFERENCE ENQUIRIES SENT TO THE
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. AS AN EXPERIMENT, ENQUIRIES OF A GENERAL NATURE, NOT
SPECIFICALLY NEEDING AN ANSWER FROM THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, WERE PASSED ONTO
OREGON STATE LIBRARY TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND SPEED UP REPLIES. LATER OTHER
STATE LIBRARIES JOINED THE SCHEME. SUGGESTS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AT
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, REFERRAL FROM THE BOTTOM UP AS WELL AS THE TOP DOWN, AND
THE USE OF ELECTRONIC MAIL.
