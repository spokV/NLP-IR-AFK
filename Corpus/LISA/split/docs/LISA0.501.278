MUSIC IN THE LIBRARY.

EVERYONE WHO WISHES SHOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN MUSICAL RECORDINGS OF INTEREST TO
THEM AND RELATED REFERENCE MATERIAL. BUT SOME READERS NEED QUALIFIED
SPECIALIST HELP. MOST PEOPLE VISIT THE MUSIC LIBRARY HOPING TO FIND SOME SORT
OF CLUB. LIBRARIANS MUST ESTIMATE WHICH RESOURCES WOULD ACHIEVE THE MUSIC
LIBRARY'S AIMS. A LARGE RECORD LIBRARY AND GOOD TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT ARE
ESSENTIAL. SERIES OF SLIDES ACCOMPANYING THE MUSIC CREATE A BETTER ARTISTIC
AND HISTORIC ATMOSPHERE. THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD OBSERVE ALL NEW EVENTS IN THE
MUSICAL WORLD, MAINTAINING CLOSE CONTACT WITH HIS AUDIENCE'S INTERESTS AND
DEVELOPING INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP ACTIVITIES TO MAKE THE MUSIC SECTION A CENTRE
OF ATTRACTION.
