SUMS UP THE IMPRESSIONS OF AUTOMATION IN US LIBRARIES. MOST LARGER LIBRARY
SYSTEMS HAVE NOW AUTOMATED THEIR TECHNICAL PROCESSES, BUT AUTOMATION OF THE
MORE COMPLICATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC ROUTINES, SUCH AS LITERATURE SEARCHING WHICH
NECESSITATE UNIFORM AND WELL DEVELOPED CATALOGUING, IS NOT WIDESPREAD. THE
PROCESS OF AUTOMATION STARTED IN THE 60S SPURRED LARGELY BY THE GENERAL US
OPENNESS TOWARDS TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PRESSURE FROM COMMERCIAL
FIRMS. THE LACK OF INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION AND OF STANDARDISATION OF WORK
ROUTINES IN US PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS ENCOURAGED THE ADOPTION OF AUTOMATION
SYSTEMS TAILOR-MADE TO INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES. THE GENERAL IMPACT OF AUTOMATION
HAS NOT BEEN MUCH STUDIED, BUT THERE WAS AGREEMENT THAT COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY
HAD LED TO CENTRALISATION, LESS INDEPENDENCE FOR BRANCHES, BETTER
INTERLENDING, AND HAD FREED RESOURCES FOR OTHER SERVICES. ALTHOUGH FEWER STAFF
TENDED TO BE EMPLOYED, NONE HAD BEEN DIRECTLY MADE REDUNDANT. NO COST-BENEFIT
ANALYSES SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT. THE REACTIONS OF USERS, BOTH STAFF
AND READERS, WERE LARGELY FAVOURABLE, EXCEPT PERHAPS IN BRANCH PUBLIC
LIBRARIES.
