ACCESS POINTS FOR SERIALS.
     
REFERING TO MAJOR CATALOGUING CODES ISSUED SINCE 1841, DISCUSSES THE
DIFFICULTY OF CHOOSING CONSISTENT ACCESS POINTS FOR SERIALS ISSUED OR
PUBLISHED BY CORPORATE BODIES. SUGGESTS THE APPLICATION OF THE CONCEPT OF
CORPORATE AUTHORSHIP AS DEFINED BY EVA VERONA (WHICH MEANS THAT THE CHOICE OF
ACCESS POINTS FOR SERIALS PUBLISHED OR ISSUED BY CORPORATE BODIES COULD BE
CONSISTENTLY DETERMINED BY THE SAME CATALOGUING PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO ALL
OTHER DOCUMENTS) TO THE RULES FOR CORPORATE ENTRY IN AACR 2 (ANGLO-AMERICAN
CATALOGUING RULES, 2ND EDITION).
