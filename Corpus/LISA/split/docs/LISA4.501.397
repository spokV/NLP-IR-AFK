AUTOMATION OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK STATEWIDE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION
SYSTEM.
     
THE CZECHOSLOVAK SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM WAS AUTOMATED IN
1972, AND INCLUDES THE PROCESSING OF SEVERAL DATA BASES, INTERBRANCH
INFORMATION STOCKS, AND FACTOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. THE IDEA
OF COMPUTERISATION COMBINES THE PRINCIPLES OF CENTRALISATION AND
DECENTRALISATION OF INFORMATION PROCESSES ON THE BASIS OF STANDARDISATION OF
METHODS AND TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS OF SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE. FURTHER
AUTOMATION WILL COVER STATEWIDE TELENETS, TERMINAL DEVICE AND MINICOMPUTERS,
THE CREATION OF SOME ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES OF RETRO TYPE, AND
THE INTEGRATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS WITH
DEPARTMENTAL AUTOMATED CONTROL SYSTEMS.
