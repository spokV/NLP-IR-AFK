LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE CURRICULA FROM 1969-75, DISCUSSES THE

IN DUBLIN AND 13 IN EASTERN USA AND CANADA WERE VISITED IN 1978 INVOLVING
INTERVIEWS WITH OVER 130 PEOPLE INDIVIDUALLY OR IN GROUPS. 10 SCHOOLS OVERSEAS

SUMMARISING THE VARIOUS STATED OBJECTIVES FOR COMPUTER COURSES. THERE FOLLOWS
A REVIEW OF THE STRUCTURE OF SUCH COURSES AND THE VIEWS ON OPTIONS IN THIS
SUBJECT. OUTLINING THE TITLES, CONTENT, DURATION AND STAF FING, REVIEWS, WITH
SUPPORTING TABLES, COURSES FOR COMPUTER APPRECIATION, PROGRAMMING AND LIBRARY
AUTOMATION. SEPARATE TABLES AND COMMENTARY COVER THE DATA FROM THE
QUESTIONNAIRES. IN THE CONCLUSIONS, IT IS EMPHASISED THAT COMPUTING IS NOW AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION, THOUGH HOW MUCH AND FOR WHOM IS NOT
