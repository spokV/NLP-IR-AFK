PICA (PROJECT GEINTEGREERDE CATALOGUS AUTOMATISERING) AT THE START OF THE
1980S.
     
IN 1977 THE PICA (PROJECT FOR INTEGRATED CATALOGUE AUTOMATION) SYSTEM BECAME
OPERATIONAL IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE PICA NETWORK IS THE RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT
CONCLUDED BY THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT AND UNIVERSITIES IN 1969. IN ADDITION A
NUMBER OF OTHER LIBRARIES, INCLUDING LEEUWAARDEN COUNTY LIBRARY AND THE PUBLIC
LIBRARIES OF AMSTERDAM AND THE HAGUE ARE MEMBERS OF THE NETWORK AS 'CUSTOMER'
LIBRARIES. OVERALL SUPERVISION OF THE NETWORK IS MAINTAINED BY THE PICA BUREAU
LOCATED IN THE ROYAL LIBRARY. MEMBER LIBRARIES CONTRIBUTE CATALOGUE RECORDS
VIA ON-LINE VISUAL DISPLAY TERMINALS DIRECT TO THE CENTRAL DATA BASE, FROM
WHICH OUTPUT MAY BE OBTAINED IN THE FORM OF CATALOGUE CARDS, PAPER PRINTOUT OR
MICROFICHE. IN 1982 THE CENTRAL DATA BASE WILL BE ADAPTED FOR USE IN
ACQUISITION AND LOANS CONTROL SYSTEMS AND IN 1983 WILL BE USED FOR THE
NATIONAL INTERLIBRARY-LENDING NETWORK.
