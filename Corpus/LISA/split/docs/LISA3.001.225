DEVELOPING A FOCUS FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION RESEARCH IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.
     
THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH INTO SOCIAL SCIENCE LIBRARY, INFORMATION, AND
DOCUMENTATION PROBLEMS IS REVIEWED WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO WORK IN THE UK
SINCE THE MID-1960S. SOME VERY PROMISING LINES OF INVESTIGATION WERE OPENED UP
THROUGH FUNDED RESEARCH. SINCE THE MID-1970S, THERE HAS BEEN LESS SUPPORT FOR
WORK IN THIS FIELD, ALTHOUGH THERE IS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION,
DEVELOPMENT, AND INNOVATION OF SERVICES. DEVELOPMENTS MUST TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE
SPECIAL NEEDS AND NATURE OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. SOME BACKGROUND ISSUES
RELEVANT TO DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION POLICIES FOR THE DISCIPLINE
ARE DISCUSSED IN A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT. THESE MATTERS FORM THE
AGENDA FOR THE STANDING CONFERENCE ON SOCIAL SCIENCE INFORMATION (SCOSSI),
WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN 1977.
