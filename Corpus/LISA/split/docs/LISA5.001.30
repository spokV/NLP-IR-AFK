THE MAIN TASKS FOR CZECHOSLOVAK LIBRARIES AFTER THE XVITH COMMUNIST PARTY
CONGRESS.

PUBLIC LIBRARIES, ACTING AS AN EFFECTIVE ASSISTANT OF PARTY ORGANS AND
ORGANISATIONS, PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN GAINING SUPPORT FOR THE COMMUNIST
PARTY POLICIES, ITS PROGRAMME FOR WORLD PEACE AND THE BUILDING OF A DEVELOPED
SOCIALIST SOCIETY. TOGETHER WITH THE CZECHOSLOVAK SYSTEM FOR SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL INFORMATION THEY ARE TO PLAY AN EVEN MORE PROMINENT ROLE IN MAKING
AVAILABLE INFORMATION FOR INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE AND RESEARCH. THE SYSTEM OF
INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE SPHERE OF CULTURE AND THE ARTS WITHIN A PARTICULAR
REGION IS BEING PREPARED BY THE SETTING UP OF REGIONAL INFORMATION CENTRES.
BIBLIOGRAPHY WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THIS PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION OF
INFORMATION. STATISTICS, LIBRARY PLANNING AND THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF
THEORETICAL LIBRARIANSHIP AND OF LIBRARY RESEARCH ARE TO BECOME EVEN MORE
IMPORTANT COMPONENTS IN THE TIME TO COME.
