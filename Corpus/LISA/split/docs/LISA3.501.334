FREEZE-DRYING-A METHOD TO SALVAGE SOAKED BOOKS.
     
134 VALUABLE OLD BOOKS WERE DAMAGED BY WATER FROM THE HOSES OF THE FIRE
BRIGADE WHEN A BUILDING USED AS STORAGE FOR THE ERZBISCHOFLICHE DIOZESAN- UND
DOMBIBLIOTHEK AT COLOGNE CAUGHT FIRE. AFTER FREEZING THE BOOKS AT -18 C IN A
COLD-STORAGE HOUSE THEY WERE DRIED IN A RENTED FREEZE-DRYING CHAMBER SOME
MONTHS LATER. THE BOOKS WERE RESTORED WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE, OTHER THAN TO THE
COVERS WHICH LOST FORM AND HAD TO BE REBOUND.
