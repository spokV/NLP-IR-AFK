ON THE PROGRAMME FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH.

COMMENTS ON THE REPORT BY THE LIBRARY SCHOOL'S WORKING PARTY ON A PROGRAMME
FOR LIBRARY RESEARCH, PUBLISHED AUTUMN 80. THE REPORT SHOWS LACK OF
CLASSIFICATION PRINCIPLES AND CLEAR DEFINITIONS. THUS THE TERMS LIBRARY
RESEARCH AND LIBRARY SCIENCE ARE USED INTERCHANGEABLY. THE ORGANISATION OF
LIBRARY RESEARCH IS NOT DISCUSSED, AND HOW RESEARCH AT THE SCHOOL CAN BE
LINKED TO ONGOING FIELD RESEARCH IS HARDLY DEALT WITH. ORGANIZATIONAL CONTACT
WITH GOTEBORG UNIVERSITY, AS SUGGESTED, IS NOT ENOUGH, LINKS SHOULD ALSO BE
ESTABLISHED WITH OTHER RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND WITH THE CENTRE FOR
INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES. THE SUGGESTED APPOINTMENT OF A DOCUMENTALIST TO
DOCUMENT INFORMATION ON LIBRARY RESEARCH IS PRAISED. THE PROGRAMME SHOULD BE
SENT TO LIBRARIES AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS FOR DISCUSSION BEFORE DECISIONS
ARE MADE.
