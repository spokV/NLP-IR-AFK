TESTING AND REVISION OF GUIDELINES FOR WRITING ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS IN THE
BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES.

GUIDELINES RESULTING FROM A PREVIOUS BRITISH LIBRARY PROJECT WERE TESTED IN
PRACTICE WITH THE COOPERATION OF 12 JOURNAL EDITORS IN THE BIOLOGICAL FIELD.
DURING THE TRIAL EDITORS ASKED AUTHORS TO USE THE PROPOSED GUIDELINES WHEN
AMENDING ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS RETURNED FOR REVISION. LENGTH, QUALITY
(PARTICULARLY INFORMATION CONTENT) AND STYLE WERE COMPARED IN 89 ORIGINAL AND
REVISED ABSTRACTS. THE REVISED ABSTRACTS SHOWED THAT THE GUIDELINES WERE OF
VALUE IN HELPING AUTHORS TO REVISE ABSTRACTS.
