ALESUND LIBRARY ON THE TOWN'S MOST CENTRAL SITE.
     
ALESUND CENTRAL LIBRARY, NORWAY, OPENED IN SEPT 80 AS PART OF A MAJOR
ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING. THE PROJECT HAD UNDERGONE LONG AND CONTROVERSIAL
DISCUSSION AND THE LIBRARIAN WAS NOT INVOLVED AT THE PLANNING STAGE, AN
UNSATISFACTORY SITUATION. THE LIBRARY (WITH MORE AND ROMSDAL COUNTY LIBRARY)
NOW OCCUPIES CENTRALLY PLACED PREMISES OF 2400 SQ.M. THOUGH ITS LONG, NARROW
SHAPE IS AWKWARD AND RATHER CRAMPED. A WALKWAY WITH STAIRS, RAMPS AND A LIFT
FROM GROUND LEVEL HELPS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LIBRARY'S SITUATION ON THE 1ST
FLOOR. THE PUBLIC ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THE WARM, ATTRACTIVE INTERIOR. AN
INTERNAL LIFT GIVES ACCESS TO BASEMENT STACKS; THE MAIN DEPARTMENTS ARE ALL ON
THE 1ST FLOOR, BUT THE 2ND FLOOR HOUSES OFFICES AND A COMPLEX OF PUBLIC ROOMS
FOR MEETINGS, STUDY GROUPS AND STORY HOURS.
