THE COMPATIBILITY OF LIBRARY SYSTEMS.

THERE ARE 2 WAYS TO ACHIEVE SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY' DEVELOP OR ACQUIRE AN
INTEGRATED SYSTEM, OR MAKE THE BEST OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO TIE YOUR CURRENT
SYSTEMS TOGETHER. COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS CAN TREAT LIBRARY DATA AS AN
ORGANISATIONAL RESOURCE, REDUCE DATA DUPLICATION, IMPROVE MANAGEMENT
INFORMATION, REDUCE THE OVERHEAD REQUIRED FOR SEPARATE SYSTEMS OPERATIONS, AND
MAKE CONVERSION TO FUTURE TECHNOLOGY MORE FEASIBLE. PLANNING FOR COMPUTER
SYSTEMS COMPATIBILITY MUST BE COORDINATED BY THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE
LIBRARY, WHO CAN REFEREE DEPARTMENTAL CONFLICTS.
