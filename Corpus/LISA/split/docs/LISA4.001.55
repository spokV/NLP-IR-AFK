DINNER OF THE ACT BRANCH OF THE LAA, 25 SEPT 81. EXAMINES CRITICALLY THE CODES
OF ETHICS FOR LIBRARIANS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE USA AND THE UK, AND
DISCUSSES A NUMBER OF POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION WHEN DRAWING UP SUCH A CODE FOR
AUSTRALIAN LIBRARIES. CONSIDERS THE ISSUES THAT GIVE RISE TO QUESTIONS OF
PROFESSIONAL ETHICS-IN PARTICULAR LITERATURE CONTROLS (CENSORSHIP) AND THE
CLIENT'S RIGHT TO PRIVACY (FREEDOM TO READ). ARGUES THAT SUCH A CODE SHOULD BE
PRECISE AND CLEAR AND TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THE FACT THAT LIBRARIANS DISPOSE OF A
