CENTRES FOR ACQUISITION AND DISSEMINATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION' THE FRENCH MINISTRY OF UNIVERSITIES INFORMATION POLICY.

AS PART OF THE PROJECTED FRENCH NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM, THE 1ST STAGE OF
THE CADIST PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED IN JAN 81, WHEN 10 UNIVERSITIES TOOK
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION IN 11
DESIGNATED FIELDS. EVENTUALLY 20 UNIVERSITIES WILL COVER A TOTAL OF 30 SUBJECT
AREAS, OBTAINING THE MOST COMPLETE INFORMATION AND SIMPLIFYING ACCESS TO
PRIMARY SOURCES. THE REASONS FOR CHOOSING THIS KIND OF SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO
THE UK OR GERMAN MODELS, THE SELECTION OF CENTRES AND THEIR MANDATE, AND THEIR
RIGHTS AND DUTIES AS OFFICIALLY PRESCRIBED, ARE DISCUSSED.
