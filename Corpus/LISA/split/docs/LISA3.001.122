ARCHIVES AND DISPLAYING THE HERITAGE.
     
A PAPER DELIVERED AT THE 9TH ANNUAL CONGRESS OF THE QUEBEC ARCHIVISTS
ASSOCIATION, WHICH DRAWS ON COMMUNICATION THEORY TO PRESENT A DYNAMIC
INTERPRETATION OF THE ARCHIVIST'S ROLE IN MAKING THE PUBLIC AWARE OF THE
VALUES OF THE PAST. THE ELEMENTS CONSTITUTING THE PAST ARE DEFINED, AND THE
ATTITUDES OF THE HISTORIAN AND THE INTERPRETER COMPARED AND CONTRASTED; THE
COMMUNICATION PROCESS IS THEN EXPLAINED AND ILLUSTRATED; AND A DEFINITION OF
INTERPRETATION DERIVED AND RELATED TO THE EXHIBITION OF ARCHIVAL MATERIAL. THE
ROLE OF THE ARCHIVIST AS TRANSMITTER OF THE MESSAGES OF THE PAST TO THE PUBLIC
IS THEN DISCUSSED IN DETAIL, CLARIFYING THE OBJECTIVES WHICH SHOULD BE HIS
PRIORITIES.
