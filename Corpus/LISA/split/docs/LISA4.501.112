BIBLIOTHERAPY IN THE CONTEXT OF PSYCHOTHERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH NERVOUS
DISORDERS.
     
NEUROTICALLY DISTURBED PATIENTS UNDERGOING GROUP THERAPY TREATMENT WERE
PRESENTED WITH 6 LITERARY TEXTS, INCLUDING WORKS BY BOLL AND SAINT-EXUPERY;
THEIR REACTIONS TO THEM WERE ANALYSED AND COMPARED WITH THOSE OF A GROUP OF
PEOPLE IN NORMAL HEALTH. THE PATIENTS REGARDED THE TEXTS SUBJECTIVELY, USING
THEM AS A BASIS FOR DISCUSSION OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL DIFFICULTIES; THE OTHERS
SAW IN THE TEXTS AN OBJECTIVE REFLECTION OF GENERAL SOCIAL PROBLEMS. THE
HOSPITAL LIBRARIAN HAD TO FIND TEXTS THAT WOULD HAVE A SUITABLE SIGNIFICANCE
FOR PATIENTS AND PROVIDE A STARTING POINT FOR THE REQUIRED THERAPY. IT IS
IMPORTANT THAT THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THE MEDICAL STAFF IN
SITUATIONS INVOLVING BIBLIOTHERAPY.
