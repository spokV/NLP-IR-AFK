THE TESTING OF RELATIONAL INDEXING PROCEDURES BY DIAGNOSTIC COMPUTER PROGRAMS.

INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN A RELATIONAL INDEXING SYSTEM HAS BEEN TESTED BY MEANS
OF A SUITE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS WHICH WILL CARRY OUT SEARCHES IN A VARIETY OF
WAYS, WITH, ON DEMAND, DETAILED DIAGNOSTIC FEEDBACK AT ANY STAGE. THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM CAN THUS BE EVALUATED AS A 'SYSTEM' SEPARATELY FROM
USER JUDGEMENTS OF THE OUTPUT. DETAILS OF THE PROGRAMMING ARE DESCRIBED. SOME
INITIAL RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH RESPECT TO STRENGTHS AND POSSIBLE
WEAKNESSES OF THE SYSTEM.
