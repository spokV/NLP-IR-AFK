PROCEEDINGS OF THE IBIS/PCRC CONFERENCE' LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF
PUBLISHING.

THIS CONFERENCE WAS ORGANISED FOLLOWING THE PUBLICATION OF BLRD REPORT 5485
(SEE 81/3758) BY THE PRIMARY COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH CENTRE. THE CONFERENCE
WAS AIMED AT THE SMALLER PUBLISHER AND ITS PURPOSE WAS TO PROVIDE A PRACTICAL
INTRODUCTION TO SOME OF THE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF BOOK PUBLISHING.
COPYRIGHT, CONTRACTS AND THE PRICING OF PUBLICATIONS WERE AREAS WHICH WERE
GIVEN PARTICULAR ATTENTION, AND IN THE DISCUSSION PERIODS FOLLOWING EACH PAPER
THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES TO WIDEN THE SCOPE AND TO RAISE PROBLEMS OF A VERY
PRACTICAL NATURE; IN A CONCLUDING PAPER SOME CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO THE
FUTURE PROSPECTS OF THE SMALL PUBLISHER.
