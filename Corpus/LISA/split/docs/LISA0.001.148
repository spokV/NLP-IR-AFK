DOES RATIONALISATION MEAN CUTS IN STAFF?.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SERVICE POINTS OF
KOKKOLA PUBLIC LIBRARIES. SOON AFTER THE REORGANIZATION A NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY
WAS OBTAINED AND THE WORKLOAD WAS INCREASED GREATLY. TWICE THE LIBRARY SERVICE
APPLIED TO THE COUNCIL FOR MORE STAFF AND WERE TURNED DOWN. IN 1980 THE
COUNCIL DECIDED TO CARRY OUT AN O&M SURVEY CONCENTRATING ON THE STAFF
REQUIREMENTS. AS A RESULT IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT 2 EXTRA PERMANENT STAFF AND
5 PART-TIME STAFF SHOULD BE EMPLOYED. THE SURVEY ALSO MADE RECOMMENDATION FOR
2 FURTHER SURVEYS: TO SEE WHETHER IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO INCREASE THE USE
OF CENTRALISED CATALOGUING SERVICES AND TO LOOK AT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.
