SAMPLING IN ARCHIVES' AN ESSAY ILLUSTRATING THE VALUE OF MATHEMATICALLY BASED
SAMPLING AND THE USAGE OF TECHNIQUES OTHER THAN SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING WITHIN
ARCHIVES; OR, COPING WITH 10,000 FEET OF INVOICES BEFORE RETIREMENT.
     
DISCUSSES WHAT SAMPLING IS, REFUTING THE CLAIM THAT ARCHIVAL SAMPLING AND
MATHEMATICAL SAMPLING ARE DISTINCT AND SEPARATE METHODS; ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM
OF IMPLEMENTATION, IN PARTICULAR TO SUGGEST AN ALTERNATE TECHNQIUE TO SIMPLE
RANDOM SAMPLING; AND DEMONSTRATES THE LEGITIMACY OF SAMPLING BY REPORTING THE
RESULTS OF IT CARRIED OUT ON A TYPICAL ARCHIVAL RECORD GROUP, OF KNOWN VALUES.
