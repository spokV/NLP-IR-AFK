MICRO COMPUTER SYSTEMS.

THE MICRO COMPUTER SYSTEM IS NOT UNIQUE, BUT JUST A SIMPLER VERSION OF THE
MINI AND MAINFRAME. IT IS ONLY CHEAPER BECAUSE LESS IS PROVIDED, THE
FACILITIES ARE INADEQUATE FOR MANY OPERATIONS, AND IF SIGNIFICANT ONCE-OFF
PROGRAMME DEVELOPMENT IS REQUIRED, MOST COST ADVANTAGES OF A MICRO SYSTEM MAY
BE LOST. DISCUSSES QUESTIONS WHICH SHOULD BE RAISED WHEN CONSIDERING MICRO
COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL. SUGGESTS THAT PROCESSOR, MEMORY AND LOGIC BOARDS SHOULD COST NO
CASSETTE.
