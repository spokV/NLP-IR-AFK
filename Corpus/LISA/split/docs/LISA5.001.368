A LONG FAREWELL TO 'NARROW' CATCHWORDS.

THE USE OF 'NARROW' CATCHWORDS AS A PRINCIPLE ELEMENT IN CATCHWORD CATALOGUES
IS NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE. THE TERM 'NARROW' IS TOO VAGUE AND DOES NOT CONVEY
THE CONTENT AND MEANING WHICH IT SHOULD. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'
CATCHWORD HAS ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS DEFINING A CLASSIFICATION METHOD; THIS
IS HOWEVER, NOT THE CASE. LIBRARIES WOULD BE ADVISED TO CONFORM WITH STANDARD
TERMINOLOGY USED IN DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TO AVOID FURTHER
USE OF THE 'NARROW' CATCHWORD OR 'NARROW' TERM. THE CONTROL OF CLASSIFICATION
TERMINOLOGY IS A VERY IMPORTANT AREA OF LIBRARY SCIENCE WHICH SHOULD BE MORE
CLEARLY DEFINED. EXAMINING SUCH TERMS AS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'
CATCHWORD IS, THEREFORE, 1 STEP TOWARDS ELIMINATING TERMINOLOGY WHICH HAS NO
REAL MEANING OR USE.
