AN ANALYSIS OF FACTORS INFLUENCING THE CAREER CHOICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP.

THIS STUDY OF FULL-TIME LIBRARY STUDENTS AT THE GEORGE PEABODY COLLEGE FOR
TEACHERS' SCHOOL OF LIBRARY SCIENCE WAS UNDERTAKEN (1) TO DELINEATE WHY EACH
OF THE STUDENTS DECIDED UPON LIBRARIANSHIP AS A CAREER; (2) TO DETERMINE WHAT
EFFECT LIBRARY-RELATED EXPERIENCES HAD UPON THAT CAREER CHOICE; (3) TO
ESTABLISH THE PERSONAL CONCEPTIONS OF THE CANDIDATES WITH REGARD TO A CAREER
IN LIBRARY SCIENCE; (4) TO MEASURE THE EFFECT THAT THE SCHOOL HAS UPON THE
CHOICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AS A CAREER; (5) TO IDENTIFY WHAT BRANCH OF LIBRARY
SCIENCE THE CANDIDATES WISH TO PURSUE; AND (6) TO ASCERTAIN WHY PARTICULAR
CANDIDATES CHOSE TO ATTEND PEABODY. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.
