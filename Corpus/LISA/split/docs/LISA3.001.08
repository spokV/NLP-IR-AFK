THE EVOLUTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL LIBRARY AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC COMMUNITY.
     
CONTENDS THAT THE PRESENT FAR-REACHING SCOPE AND VARIETY OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND
LIBRARY ACTIVITY AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, AS MANIFESTED IN THE WORK OF MANY
DIFFERENT KINDS OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION, ARE POSSIBLE ONLY BECAUSE OF
THE EMERGENCE AFTER WORLD WAR I OF AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WHICH DID NOT
PREVIOUSLY EXIST. SUGGESTS WHY, IN THE PROFESSION OF LIBRARIANSHIP, THE LEAGUE
OF NATIONS ORGANIZATION FOR INTELLECTUAL COOPERATION BECAME THE SYMBOL OF AND
CENTRE FOR THIS COMMUNITY RATHER THAN THE PALAIS MONDIAL OR MUNDANEUM, CREATED
BY PAUL OTLET AND HENRI LAFONTAINE IN BRUSSELS OVER 20 YEARS BEFORE.
