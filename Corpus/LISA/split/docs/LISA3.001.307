GATHERING ENEMY SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IN WARTIME' THE OSS AND THE PERIODICAL
REPUBLICATION PROGRAM.
     
THE EXISTENCE OF AND NECESSITY FOR INTERNATIONAL FLOW OF SCIENTIFIC
INFORMATION HAS BECOME A COMMONPLACE. THAT FLOW, HOWEVER, WAS DISRUPTED DURING
WORLD WAR II, WHEN AN EMERGENCY SUPPLY SYSTEM WAS SET UP BY THE USA TO REPLACE
NONFUNCTIONING BOOK TRADE CHANNELS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS' INTERDEPARTMENTAL
COMMITTEE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS (IDC) OPERATED BY THE
OFFICE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES (OSS), COLLECTED FOREIGN JOURNALS OVERSEAS IN
ORDER TO REPRODUCE THEM ON MICROFILM AND DISTRIBUTE THEM TO GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES, ONE OF WHICH WAS THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. IN LATE 1942 THE OFFICE OF
THE ALIEN PROPERTY CUSTODIAN (APC) WAS URGED TO SEIZE THE COPYRIGHTS OF THE
LEADING EUROPEAN PERIODICALS AND TO REPRINT AND DISTRIBUTE THEM. DESCRIBES
THIS REPUBLICATION PROGRAMME IN DETAIL AND DISCUSSES THE HEIGHTENED NATIONAL
AWARENESS OF THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF CURRENT PUBLISHED INFORMATIO N WHICH
WAS TO AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF AND PLANNING FOR US RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN THE
POSTWAR DECADES.
