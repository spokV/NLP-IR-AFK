ATTITUDE STUDY OF ON-LINE TERMINAL OPERATORS ON WORK-STATION ARRANGEMENTS.
     
A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED COVERING 75 ON-LINE TERMINAL OPERATORS AT
A LARGE GAS UTILITY. THEY WERE ASKED TO GIVE PREFERENCE RATINGS TO ALTERNATIVE
ARRANGEMENTS WITH REGARD TO PANELLING, SEATING, BACKGROUND MUSIC, AND THE
LOCATION OF A TERMINAL ON THE DESK. THE MAJORITY OF THE RESPONDENTS PREFERRED
AN OPEN SPACE LAYOUT TO LAYOUTS WITH SOME PANELS, AND SOME BACKGROUND MUSIC TO
NO MUSIC. THESE RESULTS ARE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE FINDINGS OF MOST PAST
STUDIES. AS TO SEATING ARRANGEMENTS, THEY GAVE THE HIGHEST PREFERENCE TO A
RANDOM ARRANGEMENT MADE INDEPENDENT OF THE EMPLOYEE'S SEX OR SENIORITY. WITH
RESPECT TO THE LOCATION OF A TERMINAL, THE LEFTHAND SIDE OF THE OPERATOR WAS
RATED HIGHEST BY ABOUT 1/2 OF THE RESPONDENTS, AND THE CENTRE OF THE DESK BY
1/4 OF THEM.
