APPLICATION OF SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY TO LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE 1ST AND FOREMOST TASK OF LIBRARIANS IN BULGARIA IS TO EDUCATE THEIR
READERS AND TO EXERCISE INFLUENCE ON THEIR READING HABITS. TO BE CAPABLE OF
PERFORMING THE JOB SUCCESSFULLY, LIBRARIANS MUST ACQUIRE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE
OF SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY. THUS, THEY WILL NOT ONLY SEE EACH
READER AS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH HIS/HER OWN FAMILY AND EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND,
PERSONAL QUALITIES, AND PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENTS, BUT THEY WILL ALSO BE ABLE
TO MAKE THE BEST OF A LEADER'S AUTHORITY IN A GROUP. EDUCATION OF CHILDREN AND
ADOLESCENTS HAS BENEFITTED FROM COLLABORATION BETWEEN TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS
AND THE EXPERIENCE GAINED MUST NOW BE USED MORE FULLY IN ADULT EDUCATION. ON
THE OTHER HAND, SOCIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY MUST BE APPLIED TO SET
CRITERIA FOR THE PERSONALITY OF A GOOD LIBRARIAN, LIBRARY MANAGEMENT AND THE
METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE OF THE RANK AND FILE LIBRARY STAFF.
