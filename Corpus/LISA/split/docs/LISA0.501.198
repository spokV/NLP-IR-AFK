QUALIFIED STAFF-A BASIC FACTOR OF FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

VOLUNTEERS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES CANNOT KEEP PACE WITH THE CONSTANT INCREASING
DEMANDS FROM THE READERS. THUS THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES PROFESSIONALLY
STAFFED IS STEADILY RISING AND AT PRESENT IS 4 TIMES HIGHER COMPARED TO 1957
AND THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS IS NEARLY 9 TIMES HIGHER. DURING THE
PAST 14 YEARS THE READERSHIP IN LIBRARIES RUN BY VOLUNTEERS INCREASED BY 7.5%
WHILE IN THOSE RUN BY QUALIFIED STAFF IT INCREASED BY 163%. THE NUMBER OF
LOANS IN LIBRARIES STAFFED BY PART-TIME WORKERS INCREASE TWICE WHILE IN
LIBRARIES WITH QUALIFIED STAFF IT INCREASED 4 TIMES. THESE ARE ONLY 2 EXAMPLES
OF HOW QUALIFIED STAFF CONTRIBUTED TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES. HOWEVER, FOR THE TIME BEING, THE VOLUNTEERS WILL BE
MAINTAINED DUE TO THE PRESENT SITUATION.
