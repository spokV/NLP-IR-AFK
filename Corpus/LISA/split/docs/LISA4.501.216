PROMOTING IN-SERVICE TRAINING IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM
(DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) FOR A SCHEME OF IN-SERVICE
TRAINING FOR DUTCH LIBRARIANS THE NBLC IN 1977 CREATED A DEPARTMENT TO PROMOTE
THE ACQUISITION OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE BY PRACTISING LIBRARIANS. THE
DEPARTMENT OFFERS COURSES ON SUBJECTS SUCH AS THE HANDLING OF AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIALS, AUTOMATION IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, CHILDREN'S STORY HOURS, AND
CATALOGUING. THE COURSES ARE GIVEN BY NBLC STAFF WITH THE HELP OF PRACTISING
LIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY SCHOOL LECTURERS AND LAST FROM 5 TO 10 DAYS. IN ORDER
TO RELATE THE SYLLABUS TO PRACTICAL LIBRARY SITUATIONS STUDENTS' PRACTICAL
EXPERIENCES ARE USED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE THEORETICAL ASPECTS
OF THE COURSES. THE NBLC PLANS TO FORM A COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE THE FURTHER
DEVELOPMENT OF IN-SERVICE TRAINING FOR LIBRARIANS.
