NTL'S COMPUTERISATION WORK AT OSLO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.
     
MEMBERS OF NORSK TJENESTEMANNLAG (THE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC
SERVANTS) EMPLOYED IN OSLO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY SET UP THEIR OWN GROUP IN
1977-78, AND ESTABLISHED A WORKING PARTY TO DEFINE THEIR PROFESSIONAL POLICY
ON COMPUTERISATION. TOPICS HAVE INCLUDED DISCUSSION ON RECENT OFFICIAL
STATEMENTS ON THE FRAMEWORK OF DATA SYSTEMS; DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION TO
SHOP STEWARDS AND EMPLOYEES; TRAINING COURSES; LIAISON OFFICERS; CONTACT
MEETINGS; COOPERATION AMONG PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS IN OSLO UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY; STATEMENTS ON CONCRETE PROJECTS; DEMANDS REGARDING COMPUTERISATION
DEVELOPMENT; REPRESENTATION ON RELEVANT BODIES; WORKING CONDITIONS AND HOURS
AT TERMINALS; NEED FOR SPECIFIC STATEMENTS ON LOCAL DATA SYSTEMS;
ADMINISTRATION OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS; AND CONTACT WITH COLLEAGUES IN OTHER
LIBRARIES. IN OSLO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY PROGRAMMES OF COMPUTER USE ARE AT A
COMPARATIVELY ADVANCED STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, SO FAR WITHOUT MAJOR CONS
EQUENCES FOR INDIVIDUAL STAFF. THE WORKING PARTY'S EFFORTS HAVE PRODUCED
GUIDELINES ON CERTAIN PROBLEMS, AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE COOPERATIVE BODY OF
WORK ON COMPUTERISATION BY PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS.
