THE LIBRARY WITHIN THE COOPERATION BETWEEN TWIN TOWNS.
     
THE IMPORTANCE OF TWINNING ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN NORDIC TOWNS FOR THE
FURTHERANCE OF NORDIC CULTURE IS RECOGNISED, BUT THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN THIS
COOPERATION IS NOT CLEAR. THE LIBRARY IS THE NATURAL POINT FOR COLLECTION OF
MATERIAL ABOUT THE TWIN TOWNS AND FOR THE TRANSFER OF MATERIAL FROM THE HOME
TOWN TO THE TWIN TOWNS. IT SHOULD ENCOURAGE READING OF THE NEIGHBOURING
COUNTRIES' LITERATURE. DESCRIBES THE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN JAMTLAND
REGIONAL LIBRARY IN SWEDEN, AND SOUTH TRONDELAG LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND THE
REGIONAL LIBRARY IN TRONDHEIM, NORWAY. JOINT SEMINARS ON NORDIC LITERATURE ARE
HELD EVERY OTHER YEAR. IT IS HOPED EVENTUALLY TO EXTEND COOPERATION TO THE
FINNISH AND DANISH TWIN TOWNS.
