THE GEOGRAPHICAL SECTION OF THE NATIONAL CENTRAL LIBRARY OF ROME.
     
THE NATIONAL CENTRAL LIBRARY OF ROME POSSESSES A RICH COLLECTION OF ANCIENT
AND MODERN MAPS. SOME 19,000 HAVE BEEN COLLECTED AND CATALOGUED AND ARRANGED
ACCORDING TO 3 GROUPINGS' CHRONOLOGICALLY FOR MAPS FROM 1500 TO 1800; BY
COLLECTION FOR MAPS FROM OFFICIAL AND PRIVATE BODIES; AND GEOGRAPHICALLY FOR
ALL THE OTHERS. IN A NEW RE-ARRANGEMENT, MAPS WILL BE CATALOGUED BY A SINGLE
CRITERION FOR EVERY LOCALITY AND TYPE, WHETHER PRINTED OR IN MANUSCRIPT.
AUTHOR AND TOPOGRAPHICAL CATALOGUES WILL BE COMPILED. TRANSFER OF THE SECTION
TO A NEW SITE HAS ALLOWED PROVISION FOR A STUDY ROOM SPECIALISING IN
GEOGRAPHY, CONTAINING AUTHOR, TOPOGRAPHIC AND CONCORDANCE CATALOGUES FOR WORKS
ON DISPLAY. CLASSIFICATION SCHEDULES ARE GIVEN AS AN APPENDIX.
