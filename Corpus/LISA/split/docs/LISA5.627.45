ABIDING BY THE LAW' LEGAL MATERIALS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

INCREASINGLY, LAW MATERIALS ARE NEEDED BY AN EVER-WIDENING RANGE OF PEOPLE,
AND SINCE THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION MOST READILY AVAILABLE TO THE AVERAGE
PERSON IS THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, THE LIBRARY SHOULD BE THE MOST CONVENIENT
LOCATION FOR LEGAL INFORMATION. EXAMINES THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF ACCESS TO
INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO INDIVIDUAL LEGAL PRACTICE AND THE ATTITUDES OF
LAWYERS, AND SUGGESTS SOME BASIC LEGAL TEXTS FOR A CORE COLLECTION. HINTS ARE
GIVEN ON THE ORGANISATION OF THE COLLECTION, AND THE MORE IMPORTANT
BIBLIOGRAPHIC AIDS ARE CITED.
