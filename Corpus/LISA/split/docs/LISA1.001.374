CATALOGING CONTRIBUTED TO OCLC' A LOOK ONE YEAR LATER.

RESEARCH LIBRARIES FACE DIFFICULT CHOICES IN ESTABLISHING TECHNICAL SERVICES
PROCESSING PRIORITIES, ESPECIALLY IN THE SELECTION OF ITEMS TO RECEIVE
ORIGINAL CATALOGUING. THE AUTHOR DESIGNED A STUDY TO EXAMINE THE DISPOSITION,
1 YEAR AFTER INPUT, OF A SAMPLE OF ORIGINAL CATALOGUING CONTRIBUTED TO THE
OCLC DATA BASE BY THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY, BLOOMINGTON, LIBRARIES. FINDINGS
INDICATE THAT MOST ORIGINAL CATALOGUING CONTRIBUTED BY THIS LIBRARY WAS NOT
SUPERSEDED OR DUPLICATED BY LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CATALOGUING AND THAT MANY
ITEMS WERE NOT CATALOGUED BY ANY OTHER OCLC MEMBER LIBRARY.
