CORE COLLECTIONS OF JOURNALS FOR NATIONAL INTERLENDING PURPOSES.

CENTRALISED NATIONAL PROVISION FOR INTERLENDING PROVIDES A BETTER SERVICE THAN
DECENTRALISED PROVISION BUT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT, SO
PARTIAL CENTRALISATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. JOURNALS ARE SPECIALLY SUITED TO
CENTRAL COLLECTIONS. CONCENTRATION OF DEMAND ON A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF
JOURNALS MEANS THAT COLLECTIONS OF 7,000-8,000 TITLES COULD SUPPLY 80% OF
DEMAND AND 2,000 TITLES 50% IN MANY COUNTRIES. THERE ARE HOWEVER PROBLEMS IN
IDENTIFYING JOURNALS FOR CORE COLLECTIONS. BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS CAN BE SHOWN
TO BE OF LITTLE HELP. ANALYSIS OF DEMAND AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING
DIVISION INDICATES THAT RANK LISTS ARE NOT VERY STABLE OVER TIME; AND VARIOUS
FACTORS SUCH AS LANGUAGE OR STAGE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WILL CAUSE
VARIATIONS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY CORE LISTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES
(THOUGH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR DIFFERENCES, ESPECIALLY IF CORE LISTS
BASED ON CURRENT DEMAND COULD BE OBTAINED FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES). ONCE A CORE COLLECTION HAD BEEN SET UP, IT WOULD HAVE TO ATTRACT
SUFFICIENT REQUESTS TO MONITOR DEMAND AND ADJUST ITS CONTENTS ACCORDINGLY. IF
A COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION IS NOT POSSIBLE, LIMITATION TO CERTAIN SUBJECTS HAS
ADVANTAGES. AS COLLECTIONS GROW, ADDITIONAL JOURNALS WILL BE CHEAPER TO
ACQUIRE, THOUGH THE UNIT COST PER REQUEST WILL STILL BE LOWER FOR THE JOURNALS
IN HEAVIEST DEMAND. CONCLUDES THAT THE CONCEPT OF CORE COLLECTIONS IS SOUND,
BUT FURTHER DATA ARE NEEDED BEFORE THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF SETTING UP SUCH
COLLECTIONS CAN BE PROPERLY ASSESSED.
