COMPUTER PERCEPTION OF TOPOLOGICAL SYMMETRY VIA CANONICAL NUMBERING OF ATOMS.

AN ALGORITHM FOR PERCEPTION OF TOPOLOGICAL SYMMETRY HAS BEEN PROGRAMMED FOR
COMPUTER USE. THE ALGORITHM IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF THE SMALLEST BINARY
CODE FOR A GRAPH AND REQUIRES GENERATION OF ALL NUMBERINGS FOR A STRUCTURE
WHICH WILL PRODUCE THE CANONICAL FORM FOR THE ADJACENCY MATRIX. THE UNIQUE
ADJACENCY MATRIX CORRESPONDS TO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE (BINARY) NUMBER
REPRESENTING THE STRUCTURE WHEN ITS ROWS ARE READ FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND FROM
LEFT TO RIGHT. OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM IS ILLUSTRATED WITH A SELECTION OF
POLYCYCLIC STRUCTURES.
