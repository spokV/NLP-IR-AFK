ANATOMY OF FAILURE' ONTARIO MECHANICS' INSTITUTES, 1835-1895.
     
DISCUSSES THE RISE AND FALL OF MECHANICS' INSTITUTES IN ONTARIO. THE
INSTITUTES WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL EDUCATION FOR
MECHANICS TO MAKE THEM BETTER WORKERS, BETTER PEOPLE AND BETTER CITIZENS. THEY
FAILED IN THIS LARGELY BECAUSE WHAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDED THEM TO PROVIDE
WAS NOT WHAT WAS NEEDED BY THE PEOPLE THAT THEY SERVED. WORKERS AND
APPRENTICES DID NOT ATTEND CLASSES IN LARGE NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY WERE PROBABLY
EXHAUSTED AFTER A 10 OR 11 HOUR DAY. THROUGH LEGISLATION THE INSTITUTES WERE
CONVERTED TO FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
