POPULAR FICTION SELECTION IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES: IMPLICATIONS OF POPULAR CULTURE
STUDIES.
     
PROPOSES THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIANS, IN SELECTING POPULAR FICTION, ABOLISH THE
CONFLICT BETWEEN HIGH VALUES AND 'LOW' TASTES BY FORMULATING SELECTION PLANS
IN WHICH VALUE IS INSTRUMENTAL-CONDITIONAL UPON THE DEGREE TO WHICH A WORK OF
FICTION MEETS OR FAILS TO MEET IDENTIFIED NEEDS. IN THIS WAY THEY WILL COME TO
UNDERSTAND THE WAYS IN WHICH EXISTING WORKS SERVE THE READING PUBLIC'S NEEDS,
AND SERVE THE PUBLIC BETTER.
