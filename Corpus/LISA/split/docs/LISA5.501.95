THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY' TASKS, STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE GERMAN LIBRARIANS CONFERENCE AT
REGENSBURG, 9-13 JUNE 81. REGENSBURG UNIVERSITY, FOUNDED IN 1964, HAS OVER
10,000 STUDENTS STUDYING A WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS. THE LIBRARY, STOCKING OVER
A MILLION VOLUMES, COMPRISES A CENTRAL LIBRARY AND 11 SUBJECT LIBRARIES,
EMPLOYING 215 STAFF. ALL STOCK, WHETHER OPEN ACCESS OR IN STACKS, IS
ACCESSIBLE TO ALL UNIVERSITY MEMBERS. THE STOCK CONTAINS A LARGE PROPORTION OF
MODERN MATERIAL; OLDER WORKS ARE BOUGHT ONLY WHEN ESSENTIAL FOR CERTAIN
DISCIPLINES. IN 1980 THE BUDGET FOR BOOK PURCHASE AND BINDING TOTALLED 63
MILLION DM. ALPHABETICAL, KEYWORD AND CLASSIFIED LOCATION CATALOGUES ARE
PROVIDED AND STOCKS ARE ALSO ENTERED IN THE UNION CATALOGUE FOR ALL THE NEW
BAVARIAN UNIVERSITIES. IT IS HOPED THAT STOCKS OF OLDER MATERIAL CAN BE
ENLARGED THROUGH STACK EXPANSION AND THAT INCREASING DEMANDS FOR ALL KINDS OF
MATERIAL CAN BE MET THROUGH FURTHER  INTER-UNIVERSITY COOPERATION.
