THE INVISIBLE LIBRARY.
     
ARGUES THAT THE NEGLECT OF PR ACTIVITIES BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS LED TO AN
INCREASING LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR BASIC AIMS AMONG POLITICIANS AND A
CONSEQUENT REDUCTION IN THEIR BUDGETS. THE LIBRARY SERVICE OCCUPIES A MODEST
PLACE IN THE PUBLIC DEBATE COMPARED TO OTHER SECTORS BECAUSE IT HAS NO
COMPETITORS AND THE PUBLIC LACKS A BASIS FOR COMPARISON. LIBRARY MATTERS GET
LITTLE PUBLICITY EITHER IN THE NATIONAL, LOCAL OR PROFESSIONAL PRESS. ACTIONS
BY USER GROUPS, ESPECIALLY IF THESE ARE GENERALLY RESPECTED CITIZENS, CAN BE
VERY EFFECTIVE AND CONTACT WITH ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
AND THE TRADE UNIONS SHOULD BE NURTURED BY THE LIBRARY. THIS COULD TAKE THE
FORM OF 'FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY GROUPS, AS FOUND LARGELY IN THE USA, OR, MORE
IN LINE WITH DANISH PRACTICE, USER COUNCILS.
