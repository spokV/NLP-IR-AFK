PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORKING: NEAT, PLAUSIBLE, AND WRONG.

ARGUES THAT DEVELOPING NETWORKS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE USA IS NOT THE
ANSWER TO PROBLEMS OF LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES. USERS PREFER TO TAKE A 2ND
CHOICE WHICH IS AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY FROM THE SHELVES TO A 1ST CHOICE WHICH
HAS TO BE OBTAINED FROM ELSEWHERE AND THE 1ST THING TO BE CUT AS FUNDING FALLS
IS RESOURCE SHARING ACTIVITIES. PRESENTS STATISTICS FOR INTERLOANS IN
CALIFORNIA AND ILLINOIS TO SHOW WHAT A MINUTE % OF CIRCULATION IS ACCOUNTED
FOR BY INTERLOANS. RELYING HEAVILY ON MATERIALS NOT AVAILABLE AT ONCE IN A
LIBRARY IS AKIN TO A RETURN TO CLOSED STACKS. SUGGESTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN
EQUIVALENT TO THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING DIVISION.
