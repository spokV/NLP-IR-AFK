INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION' AN UNDERDEVELOPED AREA IN THE WORLD OF
EDUCATION.

CREATIVE ACTIVITIES ARE CURRENTLY FASHIONABLE; IN INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION THEY HAVE PRODUCED A VAST QUANTITY OF LITERATURE, MOST OF WHICH
MUST ULTIMATELY BE DISCARDED FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. NEVERTHELESS THESE
ACTIVITIES ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE EACH STUDENT AND RESEARCHER SHOULD OFFER HIS
IDEAS TO HIS COLLEAGUES FOR EXAMINATION; SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS TOUCH ON SEVERAL
DISCIPLINES AND SO REQUIRE MULTILATERAL PLANNING; AND NEGLECTING TO STUDY
CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE CAN PROVE COSTLY OR CAN RESULT IN VAGUE,
UTOPIAN PROJECTS. YOUNG SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS MUST DEVOTE TIME TO
LITERATURE STUDY; TRAINING AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL AND IN THE FACTORY OR RESEARCH
CENTRE IS NEEDED. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION CENTRES MUST BE USER-ORIENTED.
