DECIDING THE FUTURE OF THE CATALOG IN SMALL LIBRARIES.

IN JAN 81, THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CLOSED ITS CARD CATALOGUE AND ADOPTED AACR
2 (THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES, 2ND EDITION). NOW, EVERY US LIBRARY
MUST DECIDE UPON THE FUTURE OF ITS CATALOGUE IN THE FACE OF THESE DECISIONS.
EACH MUST DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO USE AACR 2, AND IF SO, WHEN TO IMPLEMENT
IT. PRESENTS A CHECKLIST WHICH WILL AID THE LIBRARY IN ITS PLANNING, WITH A
BRIEF BIBLIOGRAPHY OF ITEMS RELATING TO THE FUTURE OF THE CATALOGUE VIS-A-VIS
THE NEW CODE.
