THE APPLICATION OF A MINICOMPUTER TO THESAURUS CONSTRUCTION.
     
THE USE OF A MINICOMPUTER IN VARIOUS PHASES OF CREATING THE THESAURUS FOR THE
NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION MATERIALS (NICSEM) DATA BASE
IS DESCRIBED. THE MINICOMPUTER IS USED TO COLLECT, EDIT, AND CORRECT CANDIDATE
THESAURUS TERMS. THE USE OF THE MINICOMPUTER EASES THE PROCESS OF GROUPING
TERMS INTO FILES OF SIMILAR CONCEPTS AND FACILITATES THE GENERATION OF
PRODUCTS USEFUL IN VOCABULARY REVIEW AND IN TERM STRUCTURING. SYNDETIC
RELATIONS, INDICATED BY ASSIGNING CODED IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS, ARE ALTERED
EASILY IN THE DESIGN PHASE TO REFLECT RESTRUCTURING REQUIREMENTS. BECAUSE
THESAURUS TERMS ARE ALREADY IN MACHINE-READABLE FORM, IT IS SIMPLE TO PREPARE
PRINT PROGRAMMES TO PROVIDE PERMUTED, ALPHABETIC, HIERARCHICAL, AND CHART
FORMATTED TERM DISPLAYS. OVERALL, THE USE OF THE MINICOMPUTER FACILITIES
INITIAL THESAURUS ENTRY DEVELOPMENT BY REDUCING CLERICAL EFFORT, EDITORIAL
STAFF DECISIONS, AND OVERALL PROCESSING TIMES.
