I AM INTERESTED IN INFORMATION AND LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. THIS WOULD
INCLUDE THE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS OF LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES NOW, AND
THEIR EXPECTED FUTURE PROBLEMS (SUCH AS ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING). ALSO,
THE INFORMATION POLICIES OF LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND THE FACTORS
WHICH MAY AFFECT THEIR PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION. WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES
AND SUGGESTED PRACTICAL STAGES IN THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS AND
IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES. LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, UNDER DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES, DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
