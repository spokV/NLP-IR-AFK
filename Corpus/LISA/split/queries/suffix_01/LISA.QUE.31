I AM CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A RESEARCH PROJECT STUDYING CONFLATION
ALGORITHMS FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PURPOSES AND THE REPRESENTATION
OF WORDS BY CHARACTER SUBSTRINGS. ANYTHING TO DO WITH STEMMING,
ABBREVIATION, TRUNCATION OR SEGMENTATION OF WORDS WOULD BE OF INTEREST,
AS WOULD LINGUISTIC STUDIES OF PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES, DESCRIPTIONS OF
STRING SIMILARITY MEASURES, AND OF DIGRAMS, TRIGRAMS, TETRAGRAMS ETC.
THUS, THIS INVOLVES THE CONFLATION OF MORPHOLOGICALLY SIMILAR WORDS
SO THAT THEY ARE REPRESENTED BY UNIQUE SUBSTRINGS.
CONFLATION ALGORITHMS, CHARACTER SUBSTRINGS, STEMMING, ABBREVIATION,
TRUNCATION, SEGMENTATION, PREFIXES, SUFFIXES, FRAGMENTATION,
MORPHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION.
