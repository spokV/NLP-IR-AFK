I AM INTERESTED IN THE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION
OF LIBRARIANS, IN PARTICULAR ANY IN SERVICE TRAINING AVAILABLE TO
QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS RATHER THAN EDUCATION AT LIBRARY SCHOOLS.  IN
SERVICE TRAINING COULD BE GENERAL OR IN ONE PARTICULAR AREA OF
LIBRARIANSHIP, E.G. COMPUTERISED RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.  PROFESSIONAL
EDUCATION, IN SERVICE TRAINING, CONTINUING EDUCATION.
