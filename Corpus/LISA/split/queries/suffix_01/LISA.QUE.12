MY DISSERTATION IS ON SUBJECT INDEXING FOR AN ORAL HISTORY COLLECTION,
MORE PRECISELY BY SAMPLING FROM THE 350 CASSETTES SHEFFIELD CITY
LIBRARIES HAVE RECORDED IN THE CITY, INTERVIEWING ELDERLY RESIDENTS.
I AM COMPARING THE FEASIBILITY OF A FACETED, MANUAL SCHEME ON CARDS,
AND AUTOMATED INDEXING, KWIC OR ASI, USING THE UNIVERSITY'S PRIME
