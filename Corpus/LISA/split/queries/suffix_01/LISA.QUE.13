I AM DOING A STUDY OF THE LIBRARIAN'S CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP FROM A
PROFESSIONAL ANGLE. I AM LOOKING FOR LITERATURE WHICH REFLECTS A
DISTINCTLY CHRISTIAN VIEW OF LIBRARIANSHIP, PARTICULARLY PRIOR TO 1973.
ANYTHING ON THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBRARIAN'S CHRISTIAN
FELLOWSHIP WOULD BE OF INTEREST. ALSO COVERAGE OF THE GROUP IN THE
PROFESSIONAL PRESS SINCE 1973, INCLUDING THEIR PRONOUNCEMENTS AND VIEWS
OF MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS OF CHRISTIAN ACTIVITY AND ATTITUDES IN THE
PROFESSION (ESPECIALLY SUBJECTS LIKE ETHICS, CENSORSHIP, SELECTION ETC.).
CHRISTIAN, EVANGELICAL, ETHICS, CENSORSHIP, LIBRARIAN'S CHRISTIAN
FELLOWSHIP, LCF.
